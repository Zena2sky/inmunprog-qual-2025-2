2024,미디어 환경 변화에 따른 영화와 OTT시리즈 서사기법 연구: 영화 <웃는 남자>와 OTT 시리즈 <마스크걸>의 비교 분석,"This paper examines the evolution of narrative structures in storytelling, focusing on the interplay between character-driven narratives and media-specific formats. Using The Man Who Laughs—a traditional feature-length film—and Mask Girl—a modern OTT series—as case studies, the analysis highlights how differences in character arcs influence and shape narrative structures that align with the unique demands of their respective media.
The study begins by exploring the character of Gwynplaine in The Man Who Laughs, whose singular and linear arc reflects the traditional three-act structure of classic cinema. The film's concise format prioritizes thematic clarity and emotional intensity, adhering to the requirements of the theatrical medium. In contrast, Mask Girl utilizes a non-linear, episodic structure characteristic of OTT platforms, leveraging its extended runtime and multiple character perspectives to explore contemporary themes such as identity, societal beauty standards, and the psychological implications of social media.
By comparing these two works, the paper underscores how narrative techniques adapt to audience behavior and technological advancements. The cinematic medium emphasizes brevity and symbolic storytelling, while the digital OTT format allows for layered narratives and prolonged character development. The study also discusses the cultural and thematic relevance of these works, highlighting their critique of societal norms and their reflections on the human condition.
This research contributes to understanding how storytelling evolves across media platforms and offers insights for creators and scholars into crafting narratives that resonate with diverse audiences in an ever-changing media landscape. By bridging traditional and modern techniques, this paper demonstrates the dynamic relationship between character, structure, and medium in contemporary storytelling.",1910
2024,Experiential Religion of English Puritanism and Its Preaching Theology and Method 영국 청교도의 경험적 신앙과 설교 신학과 방법론에 관한 연구,"The best way to define and understand English Puritanism is to approach with a view point of a movement, a spirit, a mindset or an attitude as a broad but convincing continuity found in Puritanism. The most significant coherence of English Puritanism is its emphasis on “a profound religious experience.” For Puritans, the religious experience is that in which one “encounters in an existential way God’s wrath and God’s redemptive love.” It is the key with which to understand the Puritan movement, even though its development was not only complicated but multi-faceted in its historical context. Shortly, English Puritanism was a movement to awaken spiritually nominal Christians, lukewarm churches, and even the nation, seeking profound religious experience by the work of the Holy Spirit through the Word of God, especially preaching ministry. Puritans’ emphasis on a religious experience resulted in the prominent development of the doctrine of assurance of salvation. Particularly, the English Puritans of the Spiritual Brotherhood such as Richard Greenham, William Perkins, Richard Sibbes, and Thomas Goodwin, contributed to the advancement of the doctrine. All four of them represent “traditional Puritan experimental spirituality,” emphasizing the heartfelt element as the essence of a true piety. Preaching, Puritans believed, is God’s ordained way so as to gather the elect from the world and to build up their faith as the body of Christ. The theology and method of Puritan preaching can be summarized as follows: the primacy of preaching, expository in its method and doctrinal in its content, the supremacy of intellect and much emphasis on application, and relying on dignified simplicity rather than eloquence. It can be arguable that Puritans’ deep concern for promoting vital religious experience in the minds and hearts of listeners forms the heart of the continuity that connects their preaching theologies and methods.",1939
2024,世界 華僑企業家의 네트워크에 관한 硏究,"During the colonial period and after World War II, the systematic rejection of Chinese and overseas Chinese by the colonial authorities and the local indigenous people of the countries of residence and the large-scale persecution of Chinese people became the main internal factors in the development of the overseas Chinese network. After the 1950s, the scale of overseas Chinese business management began to expand continuously in line with the economic development of Southeast Asia. In addition, the network of overseas Chinese also developed into more diverse forms. By the 1970s, the huge profits from the management performance of multinational corporations formed by overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese capital in some countries of Southeast Asia had already begun to appear in a very clear form. Such management performance of overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese capital showed a trend of further accelerated development in the 1980s and 1990s. The above-mentioned overseas Chinese network can be said to be based on the human relationships and cultural sharing networks that the Chinese people traditionally value. In fact, when mankind did not know what the Internet was through computers, the overseas Chinese network, which is a network of relationships between people, was already providing considerable help to the communication and commercial exchange of overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese people scattered around the world.",1446
2024,중국의 탄소중립정책 리스트 분석 연구 ―2022～2024년 ‘탄소중립 정책 제도’를 중심으로,中國碳中和政策的現狀反映出中國正在全面追求並積極落實碳達峰和碳中和目標。自2021年以來，中國政府採取了一系列措施來實現和推進碳中和目標，包括完善政策體系、實施生態低碳先進技術試點、加速創新和推進生態技術應用等。推廣應用碳達峰、碳中和技術、建立碳達峰試點等措施，改善生態低碳支持政策，並不斷完善有利於綠色發展的財稅、投資、金融、價格政策，推動綠色發展。綠色電力等市場驅動機制。 綜觀2022年至2024年上半年發布的碳中和政策，「從全面宣布2022年實現碳中和是國家任務，到2023年實現碳中和相關的前沿技術和產業，並在2024年、2022年和2023年可以說是「為2011年提出的政策建立法律基礎」。 2025年後中國的碳中和政策清單包括驗證條例規定的實現目標（例如《建立碳足跡管理體系的實施方案》中提出的2027年和2030年實現目標）是否實現的內容和政策。法律的提出不足以實現這個目標。,396

2024,Young Children’s Photographs as a Visual Research Method in Early Childhood Classrooms,"The purpose of this study was to emphasize how one type of visual research: photography, can be used as an everyday teaching tool in the early childhood classroom to facilitate and enhance learning. This article discusses strategies and methods on how to apply and integrate photography in the everyday lives of young children in the early childhood classroom. The focus of this article discusses how children can lead as the sole researcher in the classroom by taking control and being behind the camera lens, not the teacher. As the researcher, children can record their own experiences and speak for themselves. The camera is a creative and empowering tool, where the resulting images act as their visual voice. Findings of the literature review indicate that through photography, not only do children enhance skills in both language and literacy, but their motivation for learning increases as well. Further research needs to be implemented to increase this type of visual research for children and find ways to develop programs that can be practically applied in the early childhood classrooms.",1099
2024,阿部吉雄の李退渓研究―山崎闇斎研究との関連を中心に,阿部吉雄は、李退渓を中軸とした日韓思想の比較･交渉に関する画期的研究を行った人物として知られている。しかし実は、代表作『日本朱子学と朝鮮』(東京大学出版会、1965年)に結実する阿部の研究枠組は、1940年代前半の京城帝国大学において形作られたものであった。では、戦時下の植民地朝鮮という地場は、彼の研究にどのような作用をおよぼしていたのだろうか。本稿では、1930年代からなされていた阿部の山崎闇斎研究に着目することで、そうした問題の検討を試みた。そして検討の結果、阿部は、李退渓から影響を受けた闇斎が「皇道儒学」を築いたのだとする主張を展開していたこと、その「皇道儒学」論に基づいて朝鮮儒林を戦争に動員するための論理を形成していたこと、が明らかとなった。阿部の研究における実証的成果が現在もなお有益であることに間違いはない。とはいえ、我々はこの歴史的事実を正しく把握しておく必要があるだろう。,398

2024,Comparative Analysis of Research and Development Productivity among European Countries,"In 2024, the Korean government drastically reduced its budget by emphasizing financialsoundness and efficiency of R&D investment. Meanwhile, this discussion is in line with theR&D Paradox discussed in Europe around the 2000s. Accordingly, this paper surveyed G10European countries, Germany, the UK, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy, whichhave joined the OECD for the past 50 years (1970-2020), for the total amount of R&Dinvestment, total factor productivity, which is a proxy for science and technologydevelopment, and economic growth variables were estimated based on the permanentinventory method and growth accounting, respectively. The causal relationship between thesevariables was empirically analyzed based on the Cobb-Douglas production function. As aresult of the analysis, the R&D stock of six European countries had a positive effect on bothscience and technology development and economic growth, and it was found to be statisticallysignificant. However, the causal relationship between R&D stock and TFP was estimatedsomewhat differently by country, and the efficiency of R&D investment was higher inGermany, France, and Belgium than in the UK, the Netherlands, and Italy. In particular, majorEuropean countries were showing a decreasing trend of total factor productivity, which is aproxy for science and technology development. In addition, companies' R&D investmentefficiency is gradually higher than that of the government. This suggests that it is necessaryto improve the efficiency of R&D investment by revitalizing joint R&D and open innovationbetween the government and companies",1611
2024,全球文明倡议对 “海外汉学研究” 的启示与意义: 海外汉学的研究动向及初探韩国汉学的研究理论,本文探讨了“中国式现代化理论，即人类命运共同体—全球文明倡议”在文明对策论上的意义（创新性）、以及它对“海外汉学（Sinology，又称中国学）研究”的启示和互动等。具体来说，通过阐述海外汉学及其研究领域是实践“人类文明交流互鉴”的学术公器，即具有体现交流、对话、借鉴、融合、共存、和平、平等、多元、互惠、合作、包容等时代价值和精神的“全球共情知识网络”这一实效性的学术机制，为21世纪超链接时代提出了“海外汉学”的研究方向和蓝图。加之，还参照现行海外汉学的研究理论与方法，把知识产生的“发话位置”移动到同一东亚文明圈“韩国汉学”的生成版图，尝试从新的维度——“东亚话语（East Asia Discourse，区域视角）”来探讨海外汉学的知识体系和研究模式。以此试论，“韩国汉学研究”是“全球文明倡议之东亚探索”——东亚文明共同体的共情知识网络建立方面的一种值得关注的学术机制。,390
2024,Investigation on Digital Gaps in Kyrgyzstan,"This study conducted a survey of 300 participants to understand the patterns of digital gaps emerging amist the digital transformation of Kyrgyzstan and to identify significant factors influencing these gaps. Unlike previous research focusing solely on digital gaps resulting from digital infrastructure disparities, this paper is based on a survey designed to comprehensively grasp an integrated and multidimensional understanding of digital disparities by examining whether individuals have sufficient access to digital services and are satisfied with them. The analysis results indicate the need for policy considerations, particularly concerning digital gaps between urban and rural communities in Kyrgyzstan. Residents in rural areas utilize the internet to perform more diverse tasks, but they consume online public services less frequently than their urban counterparts. It is also noteworthy that rural residents rate satisfaction with digital services higher in all aspects than do urban residents. This indicates that rural residents may consume digitalized services less frequently not because they are dissatisfied with the services, but simply because they have a lower demand for them compared to urban counterparts. Therefore, the Kyrgyzstan government should actively provide digital literacy education to rural residents, enabling them to identify their demand for high-quality digital services, and expand content provision that aligns with their needs.",1471

2024,An Empirical Research on Intension to Use Robotaxi in China: Testing the Public Trust Factor,"[Purpose] Based on the theory of innovation diffusion, this study primarily explored the impact of five innovative characteristics of Robotaxi on public trust and intention to use.
[Methodology] This study built models and hypotheses, and conducted empirical analysis using a Structural Equation Model based on data collected through an online questionnaire.
[Findings] The research findings indicate that relative advantage, compatibility, and trialability have direct positive effects on public trust, while complexity has a direct negative impact. Additionally, relative advantage, compatibility, and observability exhibit a direct positive impact on the public’s intention to use Robotaxi. Trust acts as a mediator in the relationship between relative advantage, compatibility, trialability, complexity, and the public’s intention to use.
[Implications] This study contributes to the existing research on trust and the intention to use Robotaxi, providing valuable insights for businesses in shaping commercial strategies and for government agencies in devising policies to encourage the adoption of Robotaxi.",1113
2024,Étude sur la sensibilité chez Diderot,"Le matérialisme de Diderot a une longue histoire dans sa vie. Moniste, il unifie le corps et l’âme, depuis longtemps séparés. En relisant ses ouvrages sur la physiologie, nous observons comment la notion de « sensibilité » est utilisée pour illustrer le passage du corps inerte au corps vivant. Dans Le Rêve de d’Alembert , Diderot ne cherche pas à convaincre d’Alembert de son matérialisme. Tout d’abord, il lui fait accepter une modification de la notion de la « force » leibnizienne. Ensuite, il se sert de la comparaison entre la force vive et la sensibilité active pour déplacer d’Alembert de la physique à la physiologie car les principes de la physique ne s’appliquent pas directement aux problèmes de la physiologie. Enfin, à l’aide d’une autre analogie, Diderot passe de l’être sentant à l’être pensant. C’est ici qu’il remet en question l’existence de l’âme en supposant que les impressions, reçues dans les nerfs, les font vibrer. Il explique la transmission de telles impressions en fonction de la vibration des cordes d’un instrument : le son ne se rend pas de façon exacte pour peu que ses cordes soient bien accordées.",1133
2024,Comparative Study of Asian and European Countries- Nation Brand Perception-Reality Gap -,"Nation brand models that use only perception surveys are widely utilized; however, due to the diversity and complexity of human perception mechanisms, they may fail to objectively reflect the actual nation brand. This phenomenon, known as the Perception-Reality Gap (PRG), can hinder the development of nation branding strategies, especially when the perception of a specific nation brand greatly differs from the country's actual situation. Despite the significance of quantitative and regional studies on PRG, such research remains insufficient. To fill this research gap, this study measures PRG using the perception-based NBI model, and the SNBI model, which uses the same six dimensions and weights as the NBI, making one-to-one comparison easier. It applies theories of social psychology and cognitive bias to nation brand evaluation and proposes three hypotheses regarding the differences between people's perception and statistical reality in nation branding. To test these hypotheses, the study first conducts a cross-sectional analysis of PRG differences across 37 countries. Second, it divides the surveyed countries into three regions and classifies them into five groups based on the size of PRG differences for further analysis. Finally, it performs a longitudinal comparison analysis of PRG differences across the three regions. Additionally, based on cross-sectional and temporal evaluations of South Korea, the study provides tailored strategic directions for future public diplomacy efforts. Findings suggest that the root causes of PRG gaps include cognitive biases, social psychology, and the effectiveness of public diplomacy efforts. To explore these causes in greater depth, we propose three research directions. This research is academically significant as it is the first to propose a method for comparing nation brand gaps regionally. Practically, it offers guidance on developing balanced nation branding strategies that consider both perceptions and reality.",1986
2024,A Study on Present Status of Mountain Fortress in Korea,"This study investigated the present distribution of mountain fortress (MF) in Korea and abroad and suggested the utilization values. Korean peninsula had 1,563 mountain fortresses, of which 1,293 (82.73%) were located in Korea, and 264 (16.9%) were located in Chungcheongnam-do. When categorized by construction era, 1,185 Moutain fortresses were divided into 14 eras, and when categorized by designated cultural heritages, 317 Moutain fortresses were legally protected by dividing into‘state-designated cultural heritage’,‘City/Do-designated cultural heritage’,‘Cultural heritage resources’,‘Local relics’ and‘Cultural relics protection unit (China)’. The analysis of the geomorphic characteristics of the analyzable 195 moutain fortresses showed that the slopes were 15° to 20°, the elevation were 100 to 200 meters, and the aspect of 102 Moutain fortresses (52.31%) was oriented to the southern direction. In the future, various functional studies are needed to consider the social, ecological and educational values of the mountain fortress",1044
2024,A Study of the Practice of Prayer of Jonathan Edwards,"This study is about Jonathan Edwards’ prayer. Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758) is the most influential pastor, theologian, and philosopher in the history of evangelicalism. In “Miscellanies,” no. 332, Edwards states that “God is a communicative being.” If “God is a communicative beings,” how does God communicate with His people in prayer? The purpose of this study is to find out the worship theology as a pattern of revelation and response that Edwards pursues in prayer, one of the elements of worship. Edwards considers prayer as the practice of a divine-human conversation. God’s mercy is self-moved, not moved by His people in prayer. God prepares men’s hearts to prayer, and then answers their prayers. So, prayer is God’s favor. In his sermon “God’s Manner Is First to Prepare Men’s Hearts and Then to Answer Their Prayers,” Edwards states that God’s favor toward His people is set forth in a twofold exercise of that favor in prayer: (1) God encourages His people to pray, (2) God listens to their cry. God reveals His favor through prayer. God’s people pray to Him by His favor. For Edwards, thus God communicates with His people as a patten of revelation and response by the Spirit in prayer.
In the historical method, this study uses Edwards’ selected sermons informed by his theological writings to discern his worship theology. In his diary and sermons, Edwards recorded that he sought to convey God’s favor to His people through prayer.
In fact, researches about Edwards have been continued in various fields. Unfortunately, however, there is little research on the theology of worship that Edwards pursued. In this respect, the study will be a stepping stone to development of Edwards’ worship theology.",1716
2024,Study on Port Safety in China,"China has proposed the goal of building world-class ports, in which port safety is the core theme for realizing the goal. By analyzing the legal system of China’s port safety, it is found that there is a lack of comprehensive and specialized legislation and rationality in the legislative structure. Based on the analysis of significant port safety accidents, China’s port safety also has problems in administrative management, such as multiple management and breeding of corruption and malfeasance, as well as labor and employment problems, such as complex forms of employment and weakness of safety training. Therefore, based on the Korean port safety laws, the existing Chinese laws and rules can be revised first, and then the goal of enacting the Chinese Port Safety Act can be gradually realized. In addition, China should establish an integrated, penetrating, and whole-process safety supervision system and emphasize safety education and training.",955
2024,中国个人破产重整程序的建构,"”可以刺激消费进而拉动经济增长, 但当居民债务超过一定规模后就对消费产生抑制作用, 例 如消费卡过度透支消费、 住房抵押贷款持续增长、 房贷违约率明显上升等情况。 由此可以看出, 中 国个人负债问题已经成为不定时炸弹, 随时准备引爆, 一旦爆炸必将给社会带来无可估量的影响。 至此, 个人破产制度的呼声被推至高潮。 个人破产制度的建立是中国优化营商环境的重要一环, 也是退出市场机制的重要组成部分。 在 2004年修改的《企业破产法》中, 有专家学者建议将个人破产制度纳入进来, 但由于当时司法经验不 足, 人们的社会观念固化和技术条件的不完善等等原因并未将个人破产制度纳入进来, 随着时间的 推移, 现如今的《企业破产法》在修改中是否将个人破产制度纳入进来众说纷纭。 但大部分的专家学 者都认为中国已经积累了大量的司法经验, 人们观念转换和技术的成熟发展, 应该建立专门的个人 破产法。 目前国外早已经实行个人破产制度, 但中国还尚未建立, 针对愈来愈多的自然人在市场经 济中丧失债务清偿能力的情况下, 基于矛盾的特殊性, 中国首次出台了《深圳经济特区个人破产条 例》（以下简称《深圳破产条例》）, 在深圳进行试点工作, 并设置了破产清算, 和解和重整三种模式。 个 人破产不仅要保护“诚实而不幸”的债务人也要维护债权人的利益, 达到相应的利益平衡。 所以, 重整 程序将会成为中国未来个人破产程序的主要运用模式, 该模式主要针对“能还尽还”的债务人, 最大 限度地偿还债权人的债务。 《深圳破产条例》虽然规定了重整程序, 但由于受到种种局限性, 规定的 较为保守, 尤其是重整程序下对于程序的立法模式、 程序的启动主体、 程序方案的实施以及对程序 的事后保障措施的规定尚不完善。 在各地方立法模式中, 采用的是双轨制的自由选择型立法, 即允 许债务人自由选择破产程序, 但这可能会导致程序的滥用, 并可能损害债权人的权益。 在程序的启 动过程中, 主要的适用主体是商自然人, 但在某些地区, 将个人工商户纳入其中。 然而, 总体上, 并没 有将所有的自然人都视为个人破产的适用主体。 在申请过程中, 主要是由债务人提出的, 而债权人 尚未获得申请资格。 在程序方案的执行过程中, 提交的所有材料都是一致的, 并且没有对程序进行 分流, 同时也设置了相同的执行期限。 在程序的后期保护方面, 由于还没有建立一个完善的个人财 产登记制度, 这可能会导致债务人隐藏财产, 这不仅侵犯了债权人的权益, 还会降低社会信用制度 的完善程度。 美国、 德国、 日本和韩国的破产重整程序在百年前就已经制定实施, 积累了大量的个人 破产经验, 对中国具有较大的借鉴意义。 对立法例进行比较研究下, 在程序模式上实行双轨制限制 选择型, 制定相应的条件限制选择债务人自行选择破产模式。 在程序启动上扩大适用主体范围和申 请主体范围,在适用主体方面, 将《民法典》中所规定的自然人纳入到个人破产适用主体上, 在申请主 体方面, 授予债权人提出破产重整的权利。 同时, 兼顾效率与公平原则, 在程序方案实施上根据重整 程序的不同分别制定不同类型的方案随之予以批准并设置相应的执行期限,最后设立相应的事后保 障措施从而为中国制定属于中国特色的个人破产法提供借鉴。",1370
2024,The Impact of Takeover Announcements on Share Price: An Empirical Study about Home Takeovers and Foreign Takeovers using Event Study,"ocuses on the takeover, which has many types, including reasons for funding, types of bids, targets firms for takeover announcements, and different tactics. Based on the takeover announcement, this article presents the relationship between takeover bids and M&A, as well as the structure and financing. Particularly, it investigates the impact of M&A activities and international trade on share prices, encompassing both domestic and cross-border trade, which portrays the mechanics and strategies of takeovers for bridging the knowledge gap as fewer studies has provides the comparative analyses on both domestic and cross-border M&A. On the other hand, it enhances investors’ decision-making approach as investors rely heavily on timely information to adjust their portfolios. Last but not the least, cross-border announcements generate more favorable share price reaction and this consequent may influence the corporate managers decisions in M&A, which broaden the path for globalization of the growing interconnectivity of economics. This study presents an event study surrounding M&A, where the events are the announcement dates. When an acquisition announcement is made, the share price of the acquiring firm may fluctuate during the event period. The aim of this study is to analyse the impact of these announcements on the share price of acquiring firms and compare the price reaction between home acquisitions and cross-border acquisitions. We chose 100 observations to conduct this study: 50 of them are home takeover announcements, and 50 of them are cross-border takeover announcements. As a result, we found that home takeover announcements do not make much impact on the share price, but cross-border takeover announcements positively influence the share price. Due to positive average abnormal returns, there is some evidence of anticipation or information leakage prior to the event on day -5 for both homes as well as cross-border takeovers. Home takeovers resulted in a significant level, whereas cross-border takeovers failed to reach the critical value limits. There was evidence of a positive impact on day 0 (the event day) as a result of positive and significant average abnormal returns for cross-border takeovers.",2238
2024,近代 中國 博物學의 民族主義的 性格 – 旣存 硏究의 批判的 檢討를 中心으로,"근대 중국 사회에서 서양 박물학의 도입과 발전은 처음부터 중국 민족주의의 발흥과 맞물려 있었다. 근대 중국 박물학에 관한 기존의 많은 연구는 민족주의의 편향적이거나 단일한 서사에 국한되어 있고 일부 연구에서는 바람직한 접근법을 제시하였다. 본고는 기존 연구에 대한 비판적 검토를 바탕으로, 민족주의의 배경 속에서 근대 중국 박물학의 발전 맥락을 살펴보았고, 근대 중국 박물학의 민족주의적 성격을 이해하는 방식을 다음과 같은 세 가지 측면에서 파악하였다.
먼저 ‘민족 위기 극복’이라는 근대 중국의 콘텍스트에서 서양 박물학은 실업 진흥과 민지 향상을 위한 실용적인 것으로 여겨졌고, 변화와 개혁을 요구하는 진화론 사상의 탑재로서 자강과 구국 담론에서도 이용되었다. 그러나 이와 같은 ‘도구성’은 민족 위기 극복이라는 거시적 담론에서 일반화된 서사로 치부하기보다 그 중층적 의미를 파악해야 한다. 첫째, 박물학의 이용 목적에 있어 지역마다 시기마다 아젠다마다 그 실용성의 구체적 내용이 다양할 수 있음을 유의해야 한다. 둘째, 박물학의 이용 효과에 있어 공리주의의 작용으로 인해 박물학 지식의 생산과 보급 과정에서 착오가 발생했음도 주목된다. 셋째, 이용 방식에 있어 박물학은 과확으로서의 자율성에 의거해 어떻게 자원 확보를 위해 민족주의를 이용거나, 민족주의와 과학전문가주의 등 과학자 개인 성향과의 상호작용 속에서 어떤 영향을 받았는지도 중요한 대목이다.
다음으로 근대 중국 지식인들은 중국 명물학과 서양 박물학의 관계를 처리해야 했는데, 청 말기의 전통적 사대부들은 서양 박물학에 대한 이해가 부족함에도 그것을 중국 명물학과 접목시켜 중국 전통 문화의 우월성을 드러낸 반면, 중화민국 시기의 박물자와 신문화운동의 문학가들은 중국 명물학 전통을 살리자는 레토릭을 활용해 근대적 박물학의 보급과 사회 윤리의 구축을 추진하고 나아가 중국만의 박물학 체계를 구축하려 했다. 대부분 연구의 ‘전통·근대’, ‘국학·서학’의 이분법적 구도와 조화론적 서술을 극복하기 위해 근대 중국 박물학자들의 취사선택, 재해석과 재정립의 과정에서 나타난 문화적 민족주의와 과학적 모더니티 사이의 대화와 충돌의 기제와 양상을 살펴보아야 한다.
마지막으로 박물학 연구를 통해 근대 중국의 과학 민족주의는 두 가지 방식으로 작용하였다. 하나는 지역성이 강한 본토 물종에 대한 연구와 확보는 자연물과 과학자, 민중, 국가 사이의 물질적 연계를 형성시키며 국가의 경계, 국가 주권, 민족 자결권에 대한 의식을 강화시키고 민족 아이덴티티에 대한 감수성을 높이는 것이다. 다른 하나는 근대 중국 박물학자들은 본토 물종을 연구할 때 제국주의에 대해 민족성을 드러내는 동시에 국제 협력에 참여하는 과정에서 과학 민족주의와 과학 국제주의를 조율하면서 모순적 감정을 겪게 되고 이 과정에서 민족 아이덴티티를 모색하게 되었다. 박물학 연구 대상인 자연물의 물질적 지역성과 보편성은 근대 중국 박물학의 민족주의적 성격을 이해하는 중요한 지점이라 보여진다.",1459
2024,近二十年中國學界朝鮮時代東亞行紀硏究擧要,"近二十年來, 中國學界對朝鮮時代東亞行紀做出了相當多的學術研究: 其範圍包括中國行紀、日本行紀和“安南行紀”“琉球行紀”, 其主題涉及文獻、歷史、文學、語言、文化交流等領域, 其研究方法頗爲多樣, 其積極影響波及中文、歷史等多個學科。 中國學界對朝鮮時代中國行紀的文獻研究以考辨、整理爲特色, 歷史研究以思想史視域中的朝鮮後期中國行紀、中國體驗與觀察、燕行使團整體考察爲特色, 文化交流研究則關注從朝鮮到中國、從中國到朝鮮的雙向交流。朝鮮時代日本行紀、“安南行紀”“琉球行紀”的相關研究, 能從中國視角觀察朝鮮與日本、安南、琉球的文化交流與外交活動, 其觀點、方法與韓日學界的研究迥異其趣。 從總體來看, 中國學界現有成果的問題之一就在於對基本文獻和國外研究成果的掌握還不到位。只有在充分把握新發掘文獻、新發表論文的基礎之上, 中國學界才能實現真正的東亞視角的學術研究, 才能與外國學界進行更加深入的學術對話。",405

2024,A Study on the Manifestation of Emotional Cognitive Impairment in Visual Design,"Cognitive impairment is one of the most challenging issues in the diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases, with Alzheimer’s disease being a prime example. As the aging population continues to grow, this concealed disease requires significant attention. In today’s society, the increasing emotional needs of people necessitate the integration of emotion into design. This paper uses Alzheimer’s disease as a starting point to explore emotional cognitive impairment and the visual representation of related diseases. By analyzing the characteristics of the target population from the perspective of memory, the study reveals users’ emotional needs and extends emotional design theory into the field of visual design. It summarizes the deep emotional deficiencies exhibited by patients in visual design. For designers, recognizing social issues and using design to raise awareness of Alzheimer’s disease is crucial. Early detection and treatment are vital for the prevention and management of the disease. This research focuses on emotional cognitive impairment (Alzheimer’s disease) as the entry point, developing a series of designs centered on this concept, and studying its visual representation. By leveraging the power of design, visual communication can serve as a medium to promote health knowledge, raise public awareness, and draw attention to this group, encouraging early detection and treatment to reduce the incidence of Alzheimer’s disease.",1454
2024,Analysis of Research Paper Trends Related to Beauty Management,"This study was conducted on master’s and doctoral theses published over the past five years by Academic Research Information Service (RISS) as of May 20, 2024 to analyze research trends on management in the beauty industry. A total of 134 search terms were derived by entering the words beauty industry and management.

Second, looking at thesis topics by management sector, in terms of management strategy, there were 49 papers on human resources organization, 42 papers on customer relations, and 43 papers on marketing. Third, as a result of examining the frequency with which beauty management- related factors were expressed, ‘service quality’ appeared the most at 16 times, followed by customer satisfaction (15 times), job satisfaction (13 times), trust (12 times), value (11 times), and intention to revisit. Also, there were 10 training sessions. It can be judged that beauty management-related studies are mainly limited to human resources organization, customer relationship management, and marketing, and that the main interest is focused on the marketing field that strengthens management of members and customer service.",1332
2024,On the Review System of Village Regulations and Folk Conventions in China,"Village regulations and folk conventions are an important means through which villagers in Chinese administrative or natural villages exercise the right to self-governance granted by the Constitution. Article 27, Clause 2 of the the Organic Law of the Villagers Committees(2018 version) establishes two prohibitive legal rules: the “Non-Contradiction Rule” and the “Non-Infringement Rule” for the content of village regulations and folk conventions. Clause 3 further stipulates that village regulations and folk conventions violating these prohibitive rules should be rectified by the people's governments of townships, ethnic townships, and towns. These clauses constitute the substantive rules for reviewing village regulations and folk conventions.
However, the absence of procedural rules makes it difficult for these substantive rules to effectively function through legal procedures. In practice, although the People's Courts have the authority to review the legality of the content of village regulations and folk conventions, it is not their statutory duty to review whether village regulations and folk conventions violate prohibitive rules. Consequently, the courts do not accept related civil disputes and administrative controversies. This not only undermines the efficacy of the village regulations and folk conventions formation mechanism but also impairs the constitutional implementation of villagers' self-governance. Therefore, this paper focuses on the practical issues and challenges of village regulations and folk conventions review in rural China, exploring the background, rationale, and construction of a dual-track review system for village regulations and folk conventions compliance.
It argues for the necessity of establishing a more systematic village regulations and folk conventions legality review mechanism, incorporating both administrative and judicial reviews. More specifically, at the filing stage, the people's governments of counties (districts), townships, ethnic townships, and towns should conduct administrative reviews to annul, alter, or mandate the redrafting of village regulations and folk conventions that violate prohibitive rules. At the litigation stage, the People's Courts should conduct judicial reviews, disregarding village regulations and folk conventions content that violates prohibitive rules, and issue judicial recommendations to the relevant people's governments for lawful handling.",2449

2024,Research on the “White List” System for Personal Information Export Compliance,"The original three compliance paths for personal information export in China focused on data security and failed to effectively promote the development of the digital economy. In view of this, the State Internet Information Office of China issued the Regulations on Promoting and Regulating the Cross border Flow of Data in March 2024, which boldly proposed the “white list” system for data exit exemption from the three major pre compliance obligations by taking advantage of the authorization space given by the bottom line clause in Article 38 of the Personal Information Protection Law of the People's Republic of China, and opened up the fourth path for China's personal information exit compliance. However, the current “white list” system for personal information export is still in the initial stage of conceptual construction and principle establishment, facing problems such as a single dimension in system design and lagging systematic construction. Therefore, exploring and improving the “white list” system in depth, and unleashing its institutional effectiveness in coordinating security and development, has become a key issue that urgently needs to be addressed.
Firstly, this article clarifies the inherent value pursuit that the “white list” system for personal information export compliance should possess based on the development requirements, implementation requirements, and governance requirements of personal information export activities, and analyzes the institutional effects behind the value pursuit. Secondly, guided by institutional values, clarify the shortcomings of the design of the “white list” system based on scenario dimensions, propose the complementary functions of organizational dimensions at both theoretical and practical levels, sort out the conceptual framework of the system, and explain its surface meaning and substantive connotation. Finally, we will promote the implementation of the “white list” system from two aspects: the establishment of eligibility procedures and measures to ensure the effectiveness of the system.
The security, efficiency, and free flow of information have become ecological elements of the industrial chain that drive global economic development and social progress. The “white list” system for personal information export compliance should adhere to the principles of value balance, collaborative governance, and dynamic openness, and improve the institutional system from an organizational perspective in order to achieve multiple goals such as balancing development and security, optimizing governance efficiency, and increasing institutional vitality. There are still two steps needed to implement this system: the first, clarify the scope of information, subject qualifications, refine the list selection process, and clarify the responsibilities of all parties; the second is to implement one-stop management, establish a dynamic clearance mechanism, strengthen compliance incentives, improve information management mechanisms and regulatory networks, in order to ensure the effectiveness of the system.",3086

2024,Sweet Potato Research and Growth Potential in Paraguay: A Review,"Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) is an essential crop in the Paraguayan diet. It plays a crucial role in food security. It is a source of income for family agriculture. It has a significant potential to adapt to various climatic and soil conditions in Paraguay, making it a promising crop for improving productivity. However, Paraguay faces a deficit in the development of sweet potato cultivation technol ogy, resulting in a low productivity of 5.3 ton/ha. Efforts have been made to collect and characterize sweet potato genotypes, covering a diversity of native varieties. These efforts have laid the groundwork for future sweet potato research and development. Still, ongoing research and development of strategies are needed to address existing challenges of improving genetic resource traits and developing cultivation technology and to fully exploit growth opportunities in this sector. This review summarizes sweet potato cultivation in Paraguay, focusing on several key technical aspects. It analyzes current market situation and production conditions as well as the availability of genetic materials adapted to different ecoregions. Additionally, it explores prospects for the development of advanced sweet potato crops, including the production of high-quality, virus-free sweet potato plants with improved productivity.",1331
2024,Public Design Through the Lens of Tactical Urbanism,"This study analyzes public design based on Tactical Urbanism in South Korea and the United States through a bottom-up approach. Local communities identify and address various neighborhood issues, aiming to explore the city's long-term growth potential through small-scale projects. In the United States, the focus is on converting underutilized spaces into pedestrian-friendly areas, exemplifying how transforming an underused road into a pedestrian zone can create a comfortable and safe urban environment. This approach offers multiple possibilities to enhance pedestrian convenience and safety. In contrast, the Korean case emphasizes addressing problems and raising awareness through small campaigns within legal constraints. This method focuses on uncovering solutions by increasing awareness of urban issues and encouraging resident participation while adhering to existing laws. The essence of Tactical Urbanism lies in a thorough understanding, flexibly responding to, and adapting to the target site. Accurately identifying site-specific issues and developing appropriate strategies is crucial. Thus, this paper emphasizes that raising awareness of urban issues and creating lasting change through short-term, flexible and adaptable experimental methods is essential.",1276

2024,The Interdisciplinary Nexus: The Role of Natural Sciences in Linguistic Studies,"This paper discusses the integration of physics and mathematics into linguistic studies, arguing that such an interdisciplinary approach enriches language understanding. It highlights the historical shift from an interdisciplinary study of language in the medieval era to a more segregated approach in the early modern period, which created a gap in linguistics, especially in incorporating natural science concepts. By examining scientific principles like function, differential equations, entropy, and linear algebra, the paper shows how these can improve our grasp of linguistic phenomena. It emphasizes the role of computational linguistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence in language processing, demonstrating the benefits of neural networks in natural language processing and translation. Advocating for a return to interdisciplinary study, the paper envisions a future where linguistics leverages the natural sciences to become a more dynamic and comprehensive field, better equipped to address the complexities of language in modern society.",1064

We present a set of optimal solutions of the model and results of comparison to the existing halting patterns. We got a set of near optimal solution with less than 0.25% of the optimalitygap. The optimal solution consists of 118 different halting patterns, which is 83% of the existing patterns (144 patterns).
Moreover, the optimal patterns yield 4.0% saved total travel time compared to the case of existing patterns. The 4.0% reduction in total travel time provides margin for additional express HSR to be introduced without compromising total travel time compared to existing operation method. This shows the possibility of reducing travel time for customers who choose express HSR without losing total travel time.",979
2024,Study on the Promotion of China-Africa Trade : focusing on ICT,"This study leverages panel data models and fixed-effects models to assess the impact of ICT on China-Africa bilateral trade and the economic growth of African countries from 2005 to 2022. These methodologies account for unobserved heterogeneity, offering a robust analysis of ICT's influence on economic outcomes. The findings reveal that ICT significantly bolsters trade between China and Africa and positively influences African economic growth, particularly through fixed-line and mobile telephony. The strategic deployment of ICT provides African nations with opportunities to leapfrog developmental hurdles and integrate seamlessly into the global digital economy. The study's results imply that ICT is not only a facilitator of trade but also a catalyst for economic advancement across the continent. Despite the positive outcomes, the research acknowledges limitations due to the cross-sectional data and suggests that future studies employ longitudinal data for a more in-depth analysis.",995

2024,A Research on Machine Learning Agent in Rogue-like game,"Collecting large amounts of data in the real world is expensive and has clear limitations.
Simulation-generated environments, on the other hand, offer the opportunity to efficiently generate the necessary data and to try different things easily and quickly. In this research, we utilized one of the tools that addresses these challenges, by the Unity Machine Learning tool, to study an efficient automation model that responds to the characteristics of the rogue-like genre.
For testing purposes, we implemented a simple game, implanted an agent into the main character of the game, and fed the agent with code to shoot and avoid hostile. The implemented ML Agent successfully recognized the hostile targets and responded by shooting and dodging them. However, instead of learning to prioritize the hostile targets over time by reinforcing itself and shooting the high-risk targets first, it consistently fired in only one of the 360-degree directions given to it at the beginning, which we didn’t expected, so we improved the code. By utilizing the RayPerceptionSensor-Component2D element to directly feed the agent's sensors with information about hostile targets, we found that the agent was able to utilize its ray sensor to detect them and make much more precise aimed shots. In fact, it outperformed the original model by an average of 3.81x, proving that Unity ML Agentcan collect data through reinforcement learning in the roguelike genre.",1447
2024,A Study on Changes in the Reasons for Students' High-school Choice,"This study aimed to explore the factors affecting the tendency toward change in students’ high school choices after the implementation of curriculum diversification policies.
To achieve this, one-way analysis of variance and dual ANOVA were performed to discover the differences between each variable according to the reasons for choosing a high school. Logistic regression was also performed to measure the effects of the reasons for choosing a high school in analyzing the data of a total of 11,005 students and parents from the Gyeonggi Education Panel Study conducted by the Gyeonggi Institute of Education.
The analytical results are as follows. First, there were statistically significant differences in gender, parental participation in school choice, and school types. Second, the 2018 high school group was significantly more likely to consider convenience in commuting to school over admission to a more prestigious school as a reason for choosing a high school than the 2012 high school group. Third, the students in the 2018 group were significantly more likely to decide on school characteristics and culture as a reason for high school selection over admission to a more prestigious school than the students in the 2012 group.
The findings imply that there is a trend toward considering various factors other than grades in making students’ high school choice and that curriculum diversification policies may be one of the reasons for this change.",1461
2024,Research and Trends in Global Carbon Neutrality:Focused on SCOPUS DB,"This study analysed global trends in carbon neutrality research using Gemini, a generative AI, and topic modelling to identify carbon neutrality research trends, topics, and important future carbon neutrality research. To do so, we used SCOPUS, an academic database, to search for papers related to carbon neutrality since 2006, and analysed 1,752 papers for which abstracts were available. Frequency analysis and word cloud showed that carbon, energy, and neutrality were important, and LDA analysis showed that carbon, energy, CO2, study, and neutrality were important. The results of Gemini suggest three broad topic areas for future research: carbon neutrality policy and governance, carbon neutral technology and industry, and carbon neutrality and sustainable societies. The results of this study are expected to serve as a foundation for carbon neutrality research in various fields in recognition of the importance of carbon neutrality.",944
2024,Affecting Factors on Police Body-Worn Camera,"Previous studies related to police body-worn cameras have discussed legal and institutional problems and issues that may cause when police officers use them at the scene. In recent years, there has been a possibility that their use will be further expanded due to the revision of related laws after the test project of the police body-worn cameras is closed. This study empirically analyzes the differences among the socio-demographic characteristics of field police officers' perceptions of police body-worn cameras using two variables: citizen/resident reaction and general perception. As a result of the research, differences are identified in the variables of citizens/residents reaction according to the socio-demographic characteristics such as age and rank of the survey subjects. On the other hand, there is no difference in general perception variables according to the socio-demographic characteristics. Based on the results of the study, domestic and international research results are different on citizen/resident reactions, and this study also suggests future discussion directions in that they differ from some socio-demographic characteristics of citizen/resident reactions. This study also differs from existing studies in that no difference is identified in general perception by the socio-demographic characteristics. Through these findings, this study suggests the expansion of empirical research related to police body-worn cameras.",1453
2024,中国企业刑事合规制度的困境与出路,企业刑事合规制度的构建，能够有效预防企业犯罪，完善企业管理制度。在司法实践中，能够帮助司法机关准确区分企业意志与员工意志，防止发生员工行为损害企业利益的情况发生。 当前，中国政府正在以行政主导的方式推进企业合规管理建设。由于在行政监管领域和刑事法领域缺乏有效的激励机制，企业在建立合规制度方面缺乏主动性和积极性。主要原因在于，建立合规机制后企业无法获得宽大处理。在中国刑事实体法立法上，单位犯罪理论的缺陷，导致单位犯罪难以认定。刑事诉讼法上，没有专门针对企业合规的不起诉制度，是司法实践中存在制度障碍。面对上述问题，理论界开始了积极的探索。学者们提出，在充分吸收积极一般预防理论、暂缓起诉协议等理论的基础上，构建适合中国国情的企业刑事合规制度。分为两个方面，一是对单位犯罪和自然人犯罪采用同一认定标准，做到同罪同罚。同时，扩大刑事合规的罪名范围，向宽领域、重刑化罪名过渡。二是在中国建立专门适用于企业合规的协商性刑事司法制度，也就是在刑事诉讼法的特别程序中增加企业合规不起诉程序。确保检察机关能够依法评价企业合规计划的成果。,462
2024,Intraoperative pediatric electroencephalography monitoring: an updated review,"Intraoperative electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring under pediatric anesthesia has begun to attract increasing interest, driven by the availability of pediatric-specific EEG monitors and the realization that traditional dosing methods based on patient movement or changes in hemodynamic response often lead to imprecise dosing, especially in younger infants who may experience adverse events (e.g., hypotension) due to excess anesthesia. EEG directly measures the effects of anesthetics on the brain, which is the target end-organ responsible for inducing loss of consciousness. Over the past ten years, research on anesthesia and computational neuroscience has improved our understanding of intraoperative pediatric EEG monitoring and expanded the utility of EEG in clinical practice. We now have better insights into neurodevelopmental changes in the developing pediatric brain, functional connectivity, the use of non-proprietary EEG parameters to guide anesthetic dosing, epileptiform EEG changes during induction, EEG changes from spinal/regional anesthesia, EEG discontinuity, and the use of EEG to improve clinical outcomes. This review article summarizes the recent literature on EEG monitoring in perioperative pediatric anesthesia, highlighting several of the topics mentioned above.",1296
2024,Investigation of L-asparaginase activities in marine yeasts,"L-Asparaginase (ASNase) is a hydrolase converting L-asparagine to L-aspartic acid. It has been clinically used as an anticancer agent to treat patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In addition, ASNase is utilized to reduce a suspected carcinogen acrylamide in heated foods. In this study, we screened yeast strains isolated from various marine environments for ASNase production. Based on the morphological and phylogenetic analyses, we identified diverse marine yeasts belonging to 2 phyla, 6 classes, 8 orders, 9 families, 11 genera, and 12 species.
Among 12 yeast strains, BP-Ms2 (Cystobasidium sp.) and US-Sd3 (Aureobasidium sp.) were suggested to be putative novel species. BC-Cla8 (Debaryomyces hansenii), GH-Ll4 (Metschnikowia bicuspidata), and MPS3-W9 (Hortaea werneckii) were halotolerant, showing growth on yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) agar supplemented with 15% NaCl. Three strains including 21SA1-Ul15 (Rhodotorula babjevae), PH-Gra1 (Sporidiobolus pararoseus), and US-Sd3 showed ASNase activities. Based on the calculated enzymatic index (EI) values, 21SA1-Ul15 possessed the highest ASNase activity. Notably, 21SA1-Ul15 did not show glutaminase (GLNase) activity that is generally detected in ASNase and known to cause adverse effects on ASNase-treated patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of R. babjevae to produce GLNase-free ASNase. Overall, this study could provide fundamental information for discovery of novel ASNases. Furthermore, ASNase produced by 21SA1-Ul15 might serve an additional candidate for a new clinical ASNase with reduced side effects.",1605

2024,Recent Progress in Hemodialysis Membrane: A Review,"Chronic kidney disease leads to many people getting diagnosed with end stage renal disease. This disease is treated by hemodialysis which is the process by which blood is cleaned by a membrane and dialyzer. The membrane for hemodialysis is an important first step of this process as it is responsible for selectively removing impure elements from the blood. Although there are membranes made up of different polymers that are used, they have various disadvantages including hemocompatibility and low selectivity. To combat this, various studies have used a mixture of different polymers to change pore size, increase hemocompatibility and increase selectivity. It was seen that in all the studies conducted, a mixed membrane has greater advantages.",748

The study analyzes the three works as a performance piece and an online exhibition piece, emphasizing the audience interaction of virtual reality media art: 'Watched me' provides a prison atmosphere through a game format, 'Home After War' provides a virtual reality experience of a dangerous city after war, and 'Voice of Void' provides an immersive experience of public history through 3D animation. Therefore, the conclusion of this study is that virtual reality media art is providing rich emotions and new experiences to audiences through a variety of topics and formats, which means that visual sensitivity and content are evolving in the field of media art.",853
2024,A Text Mining Study of Airline ESG,"As environmental and social responsibilities gain prominence, the aviation industry faces growing pressure to adopt and communicate robust Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) strategies. Despite this, limited research explores how airlines address ESG themes within diverse regulatory and cultural contexts, underscoring the need for tailored approaches that align with global standards and local expectations—crucial for effective stakeholder engagement and accountability in a high-impact industry. This study aims to analyze and compare the ESG strategies of three major airlines—Korean Air, American Airlines, and Singapore Airlines—by examining their ESG reports from 2020 to 2023. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Semantic Network Analysis (SNA), the research identifies key ESG themes and investigates how these themes are influenced by each airline’s regulatory and operational environments. Findings reveal shared priorities across the airlines, such as sustainability, employee well-being, safety, and governance. However, each airline demonstrates unique emphases: Korean Air aligns environmental metrics with financial performance, American Airlines focuses on data-driven transparency, and Singapore Airlines integrates community and governance. These contextual variations illustrate how regional factors shape ESG strategies in the aviation sector. The study enriches ESG communication literature by providing a replicable text-mining framework for industry-specific ESG analysis, addressing calls for empirical, data-driven insights. Practically, findings support airline executives and policymakers in designing ESG frameworks that foster stakeholder trust and resilience by balancing global standards with regional needs, reinforcing the role of ESG as a strategic asset in aviation.",1820
2024,A Review of Laser Welding Research in Space Environments,"Infrastructure maintenance is crucial for sustaining human habitation in space environments such as space stations, the moon, and Mars. Maintaining these facilities is more economical through in-space welding rather than supplying parts from Earth. Consequently, research on welding in space environments has primarily been led by countries with advanced space technology. Recently, laser welding, which has received less attention compared to electron beam and arc welding, is gaining interest due to improvements in the weight reduction and energy efficiency of laser sources. However, the space environment, characterized by microgravity, high vacuum, and extreme temperature variations, presents challenges that make it difficult to directly apply existing welding methods. Therefore, this review paper focuses on the technologies necessary for adapting laser welding to space environments, taking into account these unique environmental conditions.",953
2024,Researching Ethically in Conflict-Affected Contexts: Examples from Educational Research Practice in the Global South and Global East,"This paper reflects on the authors’ experiences conducting educational research in conflict-affected contexts, and the implications it holds for ethical research practices today.

2024,A Study on the Image Reproduction Method and Storytelling of Media Facade,"Media facade, one of the media art production methods, strengthens the visual immersion of visitors and leads to a positive response through colorful images, colors, and video expression techniques. However, if the producer only focuses on visual image expression, it may be difficult for the originally intended message or meaning to be conveyed to the audience, and the expected effect may be lowered. This study analyzed the exhibition composition, narrative structure, and audiovisual elements through the production and exhibition cases of the media facade content, <Awakening the Treasure Ship, Asia Maritime Silk Road>, and studied image reproduction and storytelling. Through this, it was confirmed that in order to effectively display a media facade, a visual image with a narrative structure is needed rather than a linear image presentation, that continuity and repetition must be accompanied, and that it is necessary to reconstruct the story with metaphors and symbols. In the future, media facades that consider these methods will be able to provide visitors with more opportunities to enjoy culture and effectively convey the message intended by the creator.",1173
2024,A Study on the Factors Affecting Self-Esteem for Civic Education,"This study aims to discover what factors affect self-esteem and understand how much they affect it. First, The overall reliability of the 8 discovered factors was confirmed to be 73.2%. Second, the factor of 'balance' showed a high correlation with the sub-factors of self-esteem overall, and the factor of 'leadership' showed a low correlation with the sub-factors of self-esteem overall compared to other factors. Third, the explanatory power of this model was 98.6%. and his model was statistically significant. Fourth, balance was found to be statistically significant and had a larger effect on self-esteem rather than other variables. More importantly, it was found that balance had an overall positive effect on self-esteem. The implications for education through this study are as follows. First, it can be seen that civic virtues are factors that increase self-esteem, and that these variables are highly related to the development of each individual and society. Second, the civic virtues with defining characteristics are independent and affect self-esteem. Lastly, since this study was conducted with a focus on a specific region and subject, it is difficult to generalize the results unconditionally. Therefore, it is expected that follow-up studies targeting various regions and generations will continue.",1319
2024,A Study on the Semantic Interpretation of the Sea in French Songs,"This study aims to analyze the portrayal of the sea in French Songs across different eras, with the goal of identifying shifts in perception. Songs serve as vessels for emotions akin to poetry, encapsulating the essence of human experience. French songs, known for their narrative depth, reflect not only individual sentiments but also broader societal attitudes. The methodology involves selecting songs from both the 20th century, including works by Charles Trenet, Françoise Hardy, and Alain Barrière, and 21st century, featuring Claire Keim, Saskia and Gabi Hartmann, dissecting the meanings of each song in separate sections.
Across the decades, there has been a discernible evolution in song themes and moods, mirroring profound changes in societal values. In the 20th century, songs often depicted love through a lens of self-centered desire, emphasizing personal gratification and possessiveness. However, in the 21st century, there's been a notable shift towards a more empathetic portrayal of emotions, emphasizing connection and understanding with others and the surrounding Nature . This transformation reflects a broader societal trend towards increased empathy and inclusivity, evident in contemporary music's exploration of vulnerability and emotional depth.",1273
2024,A Study on the Design of Brand IP（Intellectual Property）in the Character Economy,"With the emergence of various economic models and the development of mass consumption, a new model of development, the character economy, was born in the 1970s. With the birth of this new economic model, characters no longer exist in anime, film, comics and other vehicles, but enter the market as products themselves. The biggest difference between characters and general commodities is that they have both social and economic attributes, and satisfy the spiritual needs of consumers to a greater extent. Brand IP (i.e. brand intellectual property) becomes IP by shaping the brand personality, using the content to create an emotional connection with the users and then carrying out valuable interactions, and winning the users' love and followers; under the character economy, the users are more and more willing to consume for the cultural value and connotation, and the growth of the revenue of the character economy can not be separated from the increase of the users' demand. This paper takes brand IP as the research object, and based on the theoretical foundation of the predecessors, it launches the research on how to boost brand growth through brand IP design and promote the synergistic operation of brand IP and brand. In this paper, the concepts and relationship between character economy and brand IP are theoretically sorted out through literature research method, followed by comparative analysis of excellent brand IP cases selected from three countries, namely the United States, South Korea and Japan, through comparative research method. Starting from the users' emotional needs, we will explore how to effectively meet the users' spiritual needs to provide emotional value and assist the symbiosis and growth of brand IP and brand.",1753
2024,Exploring the Moderating Role of Internet Freedom in the Relationship Between Corruption and Innovation,"Innovation serves as a cornerstone of modern economic development, yet corruption often stands as a formidable barrier to such progress. Despite its importance, research on the corruption-innovation relationship remains limited. Leveraging a cross-national dataset, this study employs regression analysis to examine how internet freedom moderates the relationship between corruption and innovation. Results reveal that corruption negatively impacts innovation, with internet freedom playing a complex moderating role: in highly corrupt environments, internet freedom exacerbates corruption's detrimental effects on innovation, while in less corrupt settings, ithelps mitigate this negative impact. This research offers valuable insights for policymakers, particularly within the context of globalization and digital transformation, underscoring the importance of understanding internet freedom's role in governance and innovation.",930
2024,Critical Retrospect and Prospects for ‘Bada Humanities’ Research,"This article is a critical retrospective and prospect on the HK-funded projects ‘Cultural Interaction Studies of Seaport Cities (CISSC)’ and ‘Bada Humanities (BH)’, which are being implemented by the International Institute of Maritime Affairs (IMA) from 2008 to 2025. The purpose of this article is twofold. The first is to share and disseminate internationally the achievements of the ‘CISSC’ and ‘BH’ research. This is why this article is published in English. The other is to examine the trials and errors and achievements of ‘BH’ research, to renew the institute, and to facilitate the development of a follow-up agenda.
In this article, we have explained that the ‘BH’ program of the IMA is the successor of the ‘CISSC’ and aims to focus on the interrelationship between the physical movement of the oceans and human activities, and to conduct interdisciplinary research and problem solving on current issues. In order to confirm the direction of the agenda research, I suggested elaborating terms such as seatizen, seavilization, and global commons based on ‘methodological seaport city’ to replace ‘methodological nationalism’; critically using national data and enhancing the use of local government data; and conducting comparative research between time and space.
The best practices in the implementation of the agenda were analyzed in terms of governance that includes public-private partnerships, agenda planning that relies on interdisciplinary research, domestic and international collective research, social diffusion of results, and international dissemination. It is suggested that the planning and implementation of the ‘BH’ successor agenda should include this flow chart in its planning, not only seeking to resolve issues arising from the relationship between seas and human activities, but also aiming to prevent them.",1841

2024,A Study on the Efficiency Analysis of Warehousing and Storage Firms in Korea,"This study conducted a relative efficiency analysis using DEA on 20 warehousing and storage companies as of 2023. The analysis revealed that companies classified in the general warehousing sector operated more efficiently than those targeting niche markets like hazardous materials or cold chain logistics. Additionally, the Malmquist Productivity Analysis showed that external factors, including technological change, contributed more to overall productivity growth from 2021 to 2023 than changes in internal efficiency. This highlights the importance of companies adopting technology and responding quickly to external factors such as deregulation and market structure changes. The study diagnoses the current situation of logistics warehouse companies in 2023, amid oversupply in the logistics center and real estate market and the slowdown of the e-commerce market. The key finding of this study is that large-scale general warehousing companies tend to perform better in the market, but what brought the productivity changes are mainly due to technological adoption and application which can also be the driving force of growth for other warehousing companies. The equilibrium of warehousing facilities are going to be changed due to the market structure changes, but what remains as the most important factor for success is combining internal efficiency and more importantly, external factors that can shift the efficiency level to a new height.",1451
2024,Preliminary Study on Children's Memory of Negative Event in South Korea Children,"This study, conducted in the context of the Constitutional Court's decision deeming the use of video-recorded statements from minor victims of sexual violence unconstitutional, aimed to empirically analyze whether children's memories become distorted or change over time following an incident. The research involved 38 children aged 10 to 18, and the results indicated that while children could recall the content of negative events relatively accurately, they struggled with accurately estimating the timing of these events. Specifically, they tended to remember the year well but were less precise in recalling the month or day. Importantly, the inaccuracy of specific temporal details was found to be independent of the accuracy of the event content. Furthermore, there was no significant correlation between age, the ability to reason about time in reverse, and the accuracy of memory recall. This study aims to provide valuable insights into the characteristics of children's recall of negative experiences, offering a useful basis for assessing the reliability of children's testimonies in legal settings.",1111
2024,"Navigating Reshoring Realities: A Comparative Study of South Korea, Japan, and the US","Research Purpose: This study examine the reshoring status in South Korea, Japan, and the US, scrutinizing reshoring policies and government efforts. This paper offers insights into reshoring dynamics in South Korea and proposes strategic recommendations for policy refinement and implementation.
Research Methods: In this study, a comparison analysis is conducted on the forces driving reshoring, reshoring status, reshoring policies, and government efforts in Korea, Japan, and the US, utilizing data from (Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy, Korea 2023), (JETRO, Japan 2023), and (Reshoring Initiative, US 2022).
Results in Research: South Korea's reshoring cases remain notably lower compared to Japan and the US. Our study highlights the critical need to redefine reshoring objectives tailored to South Korea's unique circumstances, as current objectives may not align effectively. Despite substantial investments, effectiveness remains limited, necessitating a reevaluation of objectives to better suit South Korea's context.
Research Conclusion: South Korea's reshoring process is intricate, with narrow eligibility criteria for companies, hindering the influx of returning firms. To address the challenges, South Korea should prioritize attracting large companies capable of generating significant job opportunities than small and medium sized companies. Furthermore, leveraging its skilled workforce, South Korea should focus reshoring efforts on high-tech companies to enhance competitiveness and drive economic growth.",1533
2024,Study on RE100 for Operating Energy of Railway Stations,"This study analyzed the possibility and economic feasibility of achieving RE100 in railway stations. The electric power consumption of an existing railway station was based on the KEPCO bill, and the power consumption and production data of the I-station (one of the ten railway stations analyzed in this study) were additionally analyzed. To predict the power consumption of new railway stations, the average annual power consumption of existing railway stations was applied. The amount of power produced through solar power generation facilities at the existing railway station was estimated using the actual amount of I-station’s power production for new construction, the power generation facility capacity listed in the renewable energy facility installation plan was calculated with a new correction coefficient presented by the Korea Energy Agency. As a result, self-power generation installation and maintenance costs were found to be more economically feasible for achieving RE100 for railway stations than the purchase of electricity produced by renewable energy (Green Premium).",1089
2024,A Review of Exercise Intervention Research on Timing of Treatment in Cancer Patients,"Surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy are common treatments for many cancer patients, and these treatments are associated with side effects. Exercise has been reported to be an effective way to reduce side effects during and after treatment for cancer patients.
Regular exercise has been demonstrated to enhance muscle strength, diminish fatigue, and alleviate energy depletion, a prevalent side effect of chemotherapy. This treatment also improves patients' overall physical well-being. Additionally, exercise exerts a direct impact on tumour suppression and immune system strengthening. The efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in cancer patients can be enhanced by the incorporation of an appropriate exercise programme. Further investigation is required to elucidate the specific types and intensity of exercise that are most beneficial for cancer patients. The development of bespoke exercise programmes by healthcare providers can effectively support cancer patients in managing their treatment and improving their overall quality of life. Additionally, research has indicated that exercise can enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy and other cancer treatments. Despite these promising findings, there is a paucity of research on exercise interventions according to the timing of chemotherapy in Korea. The objective of this study is to analyse the effects of exercise interventions following surgery, during and after chemotherapy, and to investigate the potential of exercise as a treatment for cancer patients.",1511
2024,A Study of the Color and Pattern of Kombucha as a Fashion Material,"This study aims to explore the diverse potential and applications of kombucha material through experiments with discarded flowers and natural dyes. In the current era of sustainable and multidisciplinary advancement, the collaboration between science and design is driving innovation in biomaterials on a global scale.
For example, growing design uses organisms such as bacteria, fungi, and algae to develop green products and processes. While kombucha has recently been recognized as a novel material and a variety of studies are being conducted, its potential as a biomaterial has not been fully explored. Notably, kombucha has limitations in terms of color diversity. To better utilize it, this study conducts research and experiments on its visual representations, such as color and pattern.
The research methodology involves the analysis of both biological and physical characteristics of kombucha material, followed by an examination of related research cases and experiments on its color and patterns. Specifically, experiments are conducted in two main directions: The first direction focuses on dyeing, including culture dyeing using liquid dyes and direct dyeing using powdered dyes. The eco-friendly natural dyes are directly extracted from discarded waste flowers. The second direction is to explore the potential for pattern expression through symbiotic cultivation with flower petals. Experimental results have revealed that kombucha material possesses unique beauty and expressive capabilities in color, pattern, and texture. Despite showing remarkable potential, current materials lack robustness and stability when directly applied to products. Therefore more in-depth research is planned in the future to address this limitation.",1747
2024,中国生态环境损害赔偿磋商制度研究,生态环境损害赔偿磋商制度是由生态环境损害赔偿义务人、权利人以及受邀参与磋商人等多方参与，通过平等协商手段解决生态环境损害救济问题的一种特殊制度。生态环境损害赔偿磋商制度是生态环境损害赔偿制度的重要组成部分。2015年《生态环境损害赔偿制度改革试点方案》首次确定了在七个试点地方展开生态环境损害赔偿制度的探索。2018年生态环境损害赔偿制度在全国范围内试行，各省、直辖市、自治区关于赔偿磋商制度的实践与探索呈现出不同的样态，各地方结合自身特点进行了不同的制度设计，最终也导致了各地磋商制度运行与现行法律体系契合程度不一，也导致各地磋商制度社会效果不一。结合省、直辖市、自治区出台的规范性文件以及磋商制度的实际运行现状来看，当前中国生态环境损害赔偿磋商制度主要存在以下问题：磋商权利主体人范围狭窄、磋商程序不完善、监督机制不健全、司法确认制度不完善等。基于生态环境损害赔偿磋商制度存在的问题，本文从扩大赔偿权利人范围、完善磋商程序、健全监督机制、规范司法确认四个方面提出了完善措施。,439
2024,Restructuring the Skies: Analyzing the Effects of Airline Mergers on Passenger Experience,"This study examines the impact of recent major U.S. airline mergers on air travel quality, specifically in terms of passenger convenience, connectivity, and flexibility. The convenience of travel is negatively affected by mergers, as passengers experience longer journeys, especially when traveling from de-hubbed airports. This impact is greater in markets where the airlines competed before merging. While the total number of destinations served may increase post-merger, nonstop options decrease, particularly from de-hubbed airports. Furthermore, mergers result in a reduction in flight frequency, thereby limiting passenger flexibility. This effect is also more pronounced in markets where pre-merger competition was present. These findings provide empirical evidence of the potential downsides of airline mergers for passengers.",834
2024,A Study on Virtual Intimacy For Otome Game immersion,"This study is based on the discovery that otome games create a space for the generation of intimate relationships through narrative texts that conform to female aesthetics. Players project emotions onto male characters through self-construction and gain emotional satisfaction in interaction. The purpose of this study is to explore how otome games maintain virtual intimate relationships with players based on the framework of game immersion.
The results of this study are as follows. First, a questionnaire was conducted on 214 otome game players, and second, the correlation between the sense of immersion in otome games and virtual emotional relationships was analyzed. Based on the research results, it can be seen that there is a significant relationship between immersion and virtual emotional relationships in otome games.
Through the optimization of the four elements of ""game experience"", ""emotional dependence"", ""game mechanics"" and ""realism"", the intimate relationship between otome game players will be stronger. It is proposed that future game design should consider how to improve players' negative impact on real-life social skills and emotional development while using the positive effects of virtual intimacy.",1227
2024,中･日･韩法人人格否认判例研究,"公司是在财产和组织上将股东与公司进行隔离，从而实现股东的有限 责任，隔离投资风险，促进创业投资的一种组织制度. 但滥用公司有限责 任的行为，损害了债权人的利益，违反了设立公司制度的宗旨，与公平 正义原则相悖. 抑制这种行为的方法之一即是法人人格否认理论. 法人人 格否认理论打破了最初设计的股东与公司之间的财产隔离，追究滥用有 限责任的股东或公司的责任，从而实现保护公司债权人或相关权利人利 益的目的. 本文对中、日、韩三国的法人人格否认案例进行了评析. 总体 上通过案例分析可以将法人人格否认法理整理出以下几点特征：第一， 法人人格否认法理以公司的独立人格为基础；第二，其性质具有不确定 性和模糊性，因此需要将理论应用于具体案例，具体问题具体分析；第 三，它是一种事后救济制度. 具体到各国，中国与日、韩不同，有公司法 成文规定，还有类似上海高等法院民二庭的《关于审理公司法人人格否 认案件的若干意见》和最高院的《全国法院民商事审判工作会议纪要》 等裁判指南. 通过本文介绍的判例可以看出，中国已经将法人人格否认法 理较广泛地应用于实践. 但通过最高院指导案例15号可以看出，虽然有了 成文立法和裁判指南，但法官在实际运用中仍存在这样那样的问题. 日本 法律对法人人格否认法理没有成为规定，本文通过介绍日本法院对法人 人格否认在法人人格形骸化、法人人格滥用、母公司对子公司的控制三 个方面的案例，说明日本法院的主张. 日本案例虽然简单，但是极具代表 性，作为指导性案例的话非常合适，参考上述案例便于法官在实际审判 中对法人人格否认法理的运用. 韩国在法律上没有对法人人格否认制度作 出具体的成文规定，但通过积累的判例已将法人人格否认理论具体的反 应到了司法审判之中，形成了自己的体系. 中国目前的司法环境、法官素质、外部监督等条件还不尽如人意. 因此，在立法上还不宜赋予法官过多 的权利. 根据目前中国的法院审判实际状况，应当像上海高院民二庭一 样，在裁判指引中明晰适用法人人格否认制度的各种要件，由法官将具 体规定运用到实际裁判中.

2024,A study of students’ perceptions of mathematics learning situations,"This study investigated how Korean elementary, middle, and high school students perceive mathematics learning situations to determine whether the mathematics classes provided in schools met the standards of a highquality educational experience. Using a comprehensive survey that considers both formal and implementation aspects of mathematics classes, responses from 15,418 students were analyzed to gain insights into their views on the classroom environment, instructional methods, and overall learning experience. The results indicate that as students advance in grade level, their perceptions of mathematics learning situations become increasingly negative, and mathematics classes are still perceived as being teacher-centered. Additionally, it was found that mathematical manipulatives and technological tools are not being effectively utilized, and that students’ learning experiences are influenced by class size and the availability of mathematics subject-exclusive classrooms. Based on these findings, several recommendations were made to improve the quality of mathematics education and enhance students’ perceptions: implementing teaching methods that increase student engagement in learnercentered classes, providing opportunities for active and diverse use of teaching aids and technological tools beyond simple calculations, maintaining appropriate class sizes, and expanding the use of mathematics subject-exclusive classrooms. These considerations are crucial for creating a more engaging and effective mathematics learning environment that aligns with evolving educational standards and meets students’ needs. The findings of this study provide actionable insights for educators and policymakers aiming to improve the quality of mathematics education in Korea.",1778
2024,Research on Financial Ratios Analysis of a Large Hotel Resort in Jeju Island,"This study aims to assess the financial health, operational efficiency, and overall performance of large hotel resorts in Jeju Island by analyzing key financial ratios over a five-year period (2019-2023). By evaluating financial ratios in four categories—stability, profitability, growth, and activity—this research provides a comprehensive view of the financial dynamics within the hotel industry, particularly as impacted by external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The research targets five major hotel resorts in Jeju Island, selected based on their market influence and availability of financial data. The data were collected from financial statements, industry reports, and regulatory filings. The financial ratios were classified into four categories: stability, profitability, growth, and activity.
The analysis revealed that the financial performance of the hotel resorts fluctuated significantly due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the early years of the study, stability ratios such as the current ratio and debt ratio showed a decline, reflecting liquidity challenges. However, by 2023, the resorts demonstrated signs of recovery through improved liquidity management and reduced financial risk. Profitability ratios like the operating profit margin and return on assets showed a severe dip in 2020 due to the pandemic but gradually recovered in subsequent years, although still lagging behind industry averages, indicating ongoing operational challenges.
Growth ratios, including revenue and asset growth rates, showed significant expansion in 2021 and 2022, reflecting the resorts' effective adaptation to changing market conditions. However, 2023 growth rates revealed variability, suggesting potential market saturation or internal operational issues. Activity ratios, such as asset turnover and accounts receivable turnover, demonstrated that the hotel resorts efficiently managed their resources, performing better than industry standards despite external disruptions.
The financial ratio analysis underscores the importance of strategic planning and operational improvements in maintaining financial stability and competitiveness in the hotel industry. While the hotels showed resilience and capacity to recover from economic shocks, continuous efforts are necessary to address operational inefficiencies and ensure sustainable long-term growth. The study highlights the critical need for hotel resorts to optimize resource management and enhance profitability to remain competitive in the post-pandemic hospitality landscape.",2563
2024,A Study on Bathroom Space Design for Elderly People in China,"Population aging has become a global issue, with China experiencing particularly severe challenges due to rapid social and economic development, coupled with a large and rapidly growing elderly population. Among the various living spaces for the elderly, the bathroom is a highly private and frequently used area that requires special attention in its design to address the unique needs of elderly users. This study utilizes research methods such as literature review, case analysis, and inductive summarization to examine the living habits, physical conditions, and behavioral patterns of the elderly within bathroom spaces. The study identifies key shortcomings in current bathroom space designs and outlines the specific design needs of elderly individuals in China.
This research categorizes elderly individuals based on age, analyzes their physical and behavioral characteristics, and establishes the relationship between their primary activities and the bathroom facilities. Additionally, the basic functions, functional zoning, and usage areas of bathroom facilities are investigated, offering practical recommendations for improvement. The study focuses on the primary issues and needs encountered in bathroom spaces designed for the elderly, providing key design considerations to meet user-centered requirements for elderly bathroom space design.
In the context of an aging society, this study proposes new strategies and directions for elderly bathroom space design, providing a theoretical foundation for future research and development in this field.",1563
2024,Narratives Across the Pacific: Pansori Performance and its Reception History in the U.S.,"The pulsating heart of traditional Korean narrative singing, pansori, has echoed through the valleys of its homeland and resonated across the Pacific, finding a unique reception in the U.S. Since the first pansori performance was introduced in the U.S. in 1964, it has steadily grown over 60 years—gaining popularity as a form of artistic and cultural expression, representing one of Korea’s quintessential musical traditions. This paper examines the evolution of pansori in a chronological framework, divided into five overlapping phases during the last six decades. Each phase represents a consequential step in the process, with every new phase building upon the achievements and developments of the preceding one, highlighting the interdependent nature of this cultural progression. In addition, each phase is intricately aligned with the evolving political, socio-cultural, and economic contexts of the Korean homeland. The timeline extends from the post-war reconstruction of the 1950s, a period deeply influenced by Cold War ideologies, through the 1960s with the subsequent system of cultural heritage established by the government, continuing through the economic boom that shaped the modern national identity, and finally arriving at the contemporary era characterized by globalization.",1296
2024,A Study on Conflict Management Types of Pre-teachers,"The purpose of this study was to analyze the conflict management style of college students and develop an educational program necessary for adaptation to school life and use it as basic data. The results of this study were, first, that 'yielding' was the most preferred type of conflict management, while 'competition' was the least preferred strategy. Second, 'cooperation' was highly correlated with 'compromise' overall, and low correlated with 'competition' and 'avoiding'. Third, it can be seen that the higher the interest in oneself, the more the 'avoiding' strategy is preferred, and the higher the interest in the other party, the more the 'yielding' strategy is preferred. It can be seen that 'cooperation' and 'compromise' were preferred when there was low interest in oneself but interest in the other person, and 'competition' was the preferred strategy in situations where both interest in oneself and interest in the other person were low. In addition, it was found that the distance between 'avoiding' and 'cooperation', between 'compromise' and 'yielding' and 'competition' was the farthest in the two-dimensional space.",1137

2024,A Comparative Study on Civic Consciousness between Pre-service Teachers in Thailand and Korea,"The purpose of this study is to investigate and compare the civic consciousness of pre-service teachers in Thailand and Korea to understand the educational culture of each country and to obtain implications for teacher education. As a result, the following results were obtained. First, Thai pre-service teachers considered the advantages of Thailand's education system providing good educational opportunities, and Korea is gaining the effects of good education. The disadvantages were Thailand's unchanging conservative education system and excessive learning, and Korea's entrance exam-oriented education system and simple teaching methods. According to the opinions of prospective teachers, both countries should make efforts to utilize the advantages and improve the disadvantages. Second, in terms of perception of the government and law, Korean pre-service teachers are more obedient to the government's authority than Thai pre-service teachers, and are also obedient to adults, teachers, and parents. On the other hand, Thai pre-service teachers thought that the judicial system was more fair than Korean pre-service teachers. In the case of Korea, the conservative and progressive regimes change frequently, so the results are likely to vary at each point of investigation. This is thought to be the same for Thailand. Third, when it comes to Asian traditional culture and identity, Thai and Korean pre-service teachers showed an attitude of empathy, and Korean pre-service teachers generally emphasized relatively higher morality and mental maturity as citizens. Fourth, when it comes to public services, Korean pre-service teachers were more critical of politicians' morality, corruption of co-authored services, and connectionism than Thai pre-service teachers. Considering the impact of teachers on students' attitudes and behaviors as democratic citizens, it is expected that the two countries will have many implications for the direction of teacher education in relation to democratic civic education if they expand the scope of investigation.",2059
2024,A Study on Factor Decomposition of Consumption Inequality in South Korea,"Purpose: This study examines the determinants of household consumption expenditure and quantifies their contribution to within group inequality by gender of household head in South Korea.
Research design, data, and methodology: This study first decomposes total inequality into within and between inequality by gender of household head. It also examines the association between a vector of household demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and household consumption expenditure in an attempt to identify how much inequality can be attributed to each of explanatory factors. This study empirically draws upon the recent national representative dataset, Survey of Household Finance and Living Conditions (SFLC) 2 021 c ollected b y Korea Statistical Office.
Results: According to the present study, inequality in 2021 in South Korea was found to be mainly dominated by inequality within population sub groups. Examining the determinants of household consumption inequality, it shows that factors and their conributions are different between male and female headed households. For instance, whilst the type of job occupation of a head appears to have a large impact on inequality within male headed households, it is found to have marginal contribution compared to within female headed households (25.2% vs. 7.4%). In case of household demography, it is observed as the second largest factor increasing within inequality among female headed households (31.2%) whereas its contribution to inequality within inequality among male group was relatively small (18.6%).
Implications: Our study suggests that target specific investigation and deep structural understanding need to be made on the different characteristics of within inequality as reflected by the different role of factors and their contributions. Amongst, the different inequality impact of higher education might reflect that the expansion of higher education had a relatively lower impact on the living stand of female group than that of its counterpart, male group. Finally, the discriminatory barriers (e.g. job occupation) against female may reduce within inequality, it could widen total inequality, worsening distribution between male and female groups.",2223
2024,An Investigation of Korean Tertiary Students’ Engagement in a Consciousness Raising Plus Lesson,"Skill acquisition theory (SAT) offers a well-supported description of language knowledge development (Anderson, 1982; DeKeyser, 2020). The use of the Presentation-Practice-Production (PPP) framework is often cited as the instantiation of skill acquisition (SAT) principles for language instruction, but the consciousness raising plus (CR+) framework, which also closely resembles the SAT progression of knowledge, offers unique advantages through its student-centered, language awareness (LA) inspired design. This study investigated a CR+ lesson in a South Korean university EFL class to examine how this framework engages learners. To evaluate its appropriacy, an analysis and comparison of engagement levels during the CR+ lesson with those during a PPP lesson using the same target language was conducted. Engagement was measured through observations of learners social, cognitive, and emotional engagement. The findings indicate that the CR+ lesson was highly effective at inducing engagement as it promoted autonomy through discovery activities, provided an appropriate challenge level through student-led activities, and encouraged social interaction through collaborative tasks. In contrast, the PPP lesson had lower and more variable levels of engagement, with frequent indicators of disengagement like distracted behavior. The results suggest the CR+ framework leverages key motivational conditions that encourage engagement, in line with LA principles. This highlights CR+'s potential as an alternative to PPP for developing skills in alignment with SAT while better maintaining learner engagement and motivation. The findings inform recommendations for EFL classroom practice and provide insights to guide future research",1733
2024,数字弱势群体权利立法保护问题研究,数字弱势群体，指的是在数字时代中，因经济贫困、能力有限以及数字科技的迅猛发展、信息传播的不均衡和数字经济的固有弊端等多重因素，导致其在获取数字资源、享受数字红利及保障法律权利方面明显处于劣势的群体。数字弱势群体权利保护是保护人格尊严与满足个人自由发展的客观需要，是建设数字法治国家的重要内容，是实现社会公平正义的具体要求，与每个人的数字化生存有着紧密的联系。 随着数字技术社会化进程的不断推进，“难以理解、难以接受”已经变成数字弱势群体对于智慧社会最直接的认识。从数字技术发展历程来看，其给人类生活带来极大便利的同时也引发了诸多社会矛盾与冲突，就立法保护而言：部分规则需要更加完善、权利内容以及权利保护的义务主体及其内容都需要进一步加以明确等。究其原因，随着数字技术在现代社会的不断深入，法律对数字技术的更新的速度已呈现出滞后性；分散型立法保护模式在其应用的广度和保护策略上都存在一定的限制；社会各部门对数字弱势群体保护责任意识欠缺等原因导致难以有效应对数字弱势群体这个特殊问题。需要强调的是，数字化的转型正在全球范围内掀起一场革命，数字弱势群体的权利保护也是其他国家普遍面临的问题。欧盟在此方面采取了统一式立法保护模式，美国采取了分散式立法保护模式。因此在数字弱势群体权利保护方面，可以借鉴欧美发达国家的实践经验，为数字弱势群体权利立法保护构建一个更加完善的权利保护体系。具体而言，首先在立法模式上：实行统一与分散相结合的立法模式，通过统一立法为数字弱势群体权利保护提供统一的法律依据，并在各个单行法中进一步完善相关规定，以确保数字弱势群体的权利得到充分实现。其次在立法内容上：第一，建立以防止损害权为核心的“知情-同意-否决”框架；第二，完善数字弱势群体权利保护规则体系；第三，明确数字弱势群体权利保护的义务主体及其内容，以确保数字弱势群体在数字化时代能够实现其权利。,786
2024,Analysis of Research on Christian Infant Parents,"Purpose of the study : The purpose of this study was to analyze research on Christian infant parents in terms of research period, research content, and research method, and seek directions for research projects related to Christian infant parents.
Research content and methods : For this study, domestic master’s and doctoral dissertation published from 1995 to 2023 by the national assembly library and the research information sharing service (RISS) were collected under the categories ‘Christianity’, ‘infant’, ‘infancy’, and ‘parent’. A total of 40 studies were extracted by searching with these keywords and excluding redundant studies. In addition, the frequency and percentage were calculated by classifying and analyzing the results into three criteria: research period, research content, and research method.
Conclusions and Recommendations : Research on Christian infant parents increased significantly between 2016 and 2020, with 10 studies (25%) conducted during this period, indicating a more active engagement in this area compared to other times. Master’s theses accounted for 39 studies (97.5%), while doctoral dissertation comprised 1 study (2.5%), suggesting a predominance of research at the master’s level. Regarding the content of the research on Christian infant parents, practice studies accounted for 34 studies (85%), while basic research accounted for 6 studies (15%). Field-related studies such as the development of parental education programs and materials for infants continued to be carried out steadily, but there was a lack of theoretical, philosophical, perceptual, and factual investigation research on Christian infant parents. Methodologically, literature reviews were prevalent, with 27 studies (67.5%), followed by quantitative studies with 10 studies (25%), and qualitative studies with 3 studies (7.5%). Various types of research, including quantitative, qualitative, and literature reviews, were conducted between 2016 and 2020. Based on the research findings, in-depth qualitative studies conducted through observation and interviews, as well as mixed- method studies complementing single studies, should be conducted for a long-term perspective on research involving Christian infant and child parents.",2246
2024,Joint Association of Hard of Hearing and Handgrip Strength with Falls in the Older Adults: A Cross-sectional Analysis of Data from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging,"Purpose: This study aimed to confirm the joint association of hard of hearing and handgrip strength with falls among Koreans aged 65 years and above.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was based on the 2020 Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging data and included 4,372 participants who completed a falls-related questionnaire. Grip strength was measured, and hearing status was self-reported. Multivariate logistic regression assessed associations between hearing status, handgrip strength, and falls. Analyses were adjusted for variables such as age, sex, body mass index, education level, and medical history.
Results: The study found a significant association between being hard of hearing and increased odds of falls (odds ratio [OR], 2.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.56–4.78). Additionally, individuals with low handgrip strength had higher odds of falls (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 0.88–3.31) than those with normal handgrip strength. Among individuals who were hard of hearing, the group with normal handgrip strength showed 28% lower odds of falls (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.18–2.87), although this result did not reach statistical significance.
Conclusion: These findings highlight the high fall odds associated with being hard of hearing and suggest that handgrip strength may have a potential protective effect in individuals aged 65 years and older. Our study contributes to an increased understanding of risk factors for falls in older adults and emphasizes the need to address sensory impairment and muscle strength in prevention efforts. Future studies must validate and extend these findings to improve quality of life and reduce fall-related injuries in older adults.",1672
2024,A Study on the Utilization of Preferential Tariffs in the Korea-ASEAN FTA,"Research Purpose: At a time when the utilization of FTA ​​is being emphasized more due to the increase in purchasing power in Southeast Asian countries, the recent Tax Tribunal's FTA Special Act-related trial request cases are showing an increase in cases where the application of the agreement tariff rate is excluded due to failure to meet the origin criteria and requirements in relation to the application of special tariff treatment. Accordingly, it is necessary to examine related issues and suggest ways for Korean companies to strategically utilize the Korea-ASEAN FTA. The purpose of this study is to explore ways to increase the utilization of the Korea-ASEAN FTA by analyzing various cases based on the decision on the origin of the issue classification among the Korea Customs Service case cases and suggesting practical implications.
Research Methods: This study examined the precedents of the Tax Tribunal related to the Korea-ASEAN FTA.
Results in Research: To apply the preferential tariffs of the FTA, importers must meticulously verify the validity of the origin and avoid arbitrary interpretation and judgment of the FTA memorandum of understanding and related agreements.
Research Conclusion: While research related to the Korea-ASEAN FTA has been conducted, there has been a lack of studies on the exclusion of agreement tariff application. This study is significant in that it examined the precedents of the Tax Tribunal regarding this issue.",1464
2024,Topic Analysis of Long-term Care Management: A Text Mining Study,"Purpose: This study employed text mining methodologies to analyze research trends in elderly long-term care facility management, with the aim of identifying significant keywords and research topics to inform future research directions. Methods: We analyzed 10,487 articles published through April 2024, collected from major academic databases. The analysis incorporated text mining techniques such as term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), topic modeling, and social network analysis to extract meaningful patterns and themes from the literature. Results: Publication trends showed consistent growth since the 1980s, with significant acceleration in the 2020s. The analysis revealed that terms such as ‘care,’ ‘management,’ ‘nurse,’ and ‘patient’ were fundamental to the field. Three primary research themes emerged: “Healthcare Management and Quality Improvement,” “Strategic Management in Nursing and Community Care,” and “Health Services and Dementia Care.” These findings highlight the necessity for increased empirical and interdisciplinary research approaches. Conclusion: The findings emphasize the critical need for enhanced management competency programs within long-term care facilities. This study presents a comprehensive overview of current research developments and provides evidence-based recommendations for future research initiatives aimed at enhancing care quality and management practices in response to the challenges of an aging society.",1472
2024,A Study on Korean Nail Salon Women and Nail Beauty in New York,"Korean nail salons in New York City commodifies physical contact between nail women and customers of diverse backgrounds and this touching evokes intense feelings among nail women. Korean nail women enter into a line of work that is at first entirely unfamiliar since Korean culture generally looks disparagingly at nail salon work because it involves intimate physical contact with another person’s body. Such body work is considered shameful and humiliating, as in the metaphor “lowering oneself to cleanse another’s feet.” Polishing one’s nails with colorful enamel is also frowned upon as behavior that offends the dictates of tradition. Despite the foreign terrain of nail work, Korean women have managed to carve out a formidable wedge in the beauty industry through the establishment of nail salons. Underlying all this market activity, however, is an uneasy relationship between women working in (nail women) and women working on (customers) nail beautification. This elucidates on the conflict-laden view of body labor and nail beautification. It also examines various nail fashion preferences across spectrums of race/ethnicity, class, age, and especially ‘Afro-nail’ in order to further understanding concerning nail beautification work. Empirical evidence suggests that fashions in nail styles vary according to race and class and that these same factors are at work in assigning value to particular expressions of style.",1433
2024,Supply-chain Inventory Management with Behavioral Consideration,"We develop inventory control strategies for a supplier who is selling a product to a group of newsvendors.
Recent research in newsvendor experiments using human subjects revealed significant behavioral tendencies in the decision making processes for inventory management. If the supplier would incorporate these behavioral tendencies while managing her inventories, her costs would be significantly reduced.
Using data from experiments, we estimate the possible reductions in supplier costs and determine the factors that significantly impact it. We observe a significant improvement in the supplier’s inventory decision if she estimates the demand distribution with a model that captures the anchoring tendencies instead of assuming aggregate randomness. As the model selection relies much on the data, it is an important task to determine whether the retailers are mean-anchoring, demand-chasing, both, or neither.
In addition, we observe that the information about retailers’ behaviors is more beneficial for the supplier when the end-customer demands are more variable. It is certain that more precise information on the data will lead to a better inventory decision for suppliers. The information includes the retailers’ behavioral tendencies, individual-specific order behaviors, and the variability of end-customer demands.",1330
2024,韩国古代诗家对欧阳修诗论的批评,"欧阳修对中韩两国诗歌的发展影响重大而深远, 其反对生硬的“造语”和单纯的“模拟前人”, 韩国古代诗家对欧阳修反抄袭的主张展开了进一步阐释和分析, 并借以告诫本国学子｡ 关于欧阳修“穷而后工”的诗学观点, 韩国古代诗家对其进行溯源批评, 讨论了诗人穷达与诗文工拙的辩证关系, 对中韩两国诗人因诗歌的错误阐释而导致的诗人生存困境表达了同情｡ 更多的诗家则站在客观的立场, 认为诗人仕途窘困在于天命不在于诗, 提出“诗不能穷人”, 为诗歌做辩护｡ 在反复的争论过程中, 实质上韩国古代诗家也在对本民族的诗学体系进行一步步的构建｡",261
2024,A Study on Cohort Effects of Unification Consciousness of South Korean,"The recent trend of declining consciousness regarding the necessity of unification among South Korean citizens is evident. Does a cohort effect exist in this downward trend in the perception of the necessity of unification? The purpose of this study is to analyze whether birth cohorts statistically significantly influence the consciousness of the necessity of unification. To this end, the hierarchical age-period-cohort (HAPC) model was employed as the analytical model, and data from the Unification Consciousness Survey conducted by Seoul National University's Institute for Peace and Unification Studies from 2007 to 2021 was used. The analysis results showed evidence that the progress of economic inequality at the birth cohort level affected the decline in the perception of the necessity of unification. The 1980s birth cohort, which faced socioeconomic difficulties during their social advancement due to income and wealth polarization, is observed to have a distinctly negative perception of unification requiring massive financial resources, compared to the 1960s and 1970s birth cohorts.",1101
2024,Augmented Reality Based Information Systems: An Exploratory Study of Understanding Children’s Perception,"Augmented Reality (AR) is a mix of the real world that is enhanced by virtual objects from computer-generated information. AR is currently used in a variety of information systems and library services. AR technologies are also being developed for today’s children, who are digital natives and are exposed to various technologies even earlier. To assist librarians who need to accurately understand users’ information needs and perceptions of the technology being used in their libraries, we conducted a study of AR perceptions among children. We conducted two online co-design sessions using “Would you rather?”, a co-design technique that facilitates research into children’s opinions. Through the co-design sessions, we found that children were psychologically wary about AR technology due to a lack of trust in the technology, and realism had a significant impact on these judgments. We also identified that children considered AR technology environments as an extension of the real world. Their real-world values directly influenced their perceptions of AR. This research provides insights into the wariness that libraries need to be aware of when developing AR content for children in the future, and how libraries can use AR as an educational tool.",1254

Methods: This cross-sectional study was based on the 2020 Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging data and included 4,372 participants who completed a falls-related questionnaire. Grip strength was measured, and hearing status was self-reported. Multivariate logistic regression assessed associations between hearing status, handgrip strength, and falls. Analyses were adjusted for variables such as age, sex, body mass index, education level, and medical history.
Results: The study found a significant association between being hard of hearing and increased odds of falls (odds ratio [OR], 2.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.56–4.78). Additionally, individuals with low handgrip strength had higher odds of falls (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 0.88–3.31) than those with normal handgrip strength. Among individuals who were hard of hearing, the group with normal handgrip strength showed 28% lower odds of falls (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.18–2.87), although this result did not reach statistical significance.
Conclusion: These findings highlight the high fall odds associated with being hard of hearing and suggest that handgrip strength may have a potential protective effect in individuals aged 65 years and older. Our study contributes to an increased understanding of risk factors for falls in older adults and emphasizes the need to address sensory impairment and muscle strength in prevention efforts. Future studies must validate and extend these findings to improve quality of life and reduce fall-related injuries in older adults.",1672
2024,A Study on Korean Nail Salon Women and Nail Beauty in New York,"Korean nail salons in New York City commodifies physical contact between nail women and customers of diverse backgrounds and this touching evokes intense feelings among nail women. Korean nail women enter into a line of work that is at first entirely unfamiliar since Korean culture generally looks disparagingly at nail salon work because it involves intimate physical contact with another person’s body. Such body work is considered shameful and humiliating, as in the metaphor “lowering oneself to cleanse another’s feet.” Polishing one’s nails with colorful enamel is also frowned upon as behavior that offends the dictates of tradition. Despite the foreign terrain of nail work, Korean women have managed to carve out a formidable wedge in the beauty industry through the establishment of nail salons. Underlying all this market activity, however, is an uneasy relationship between women working in (nail women) and women working on (customers) nail beautification. This elucidates on the conflict-laden view of body labor and nail beautification. It also examines various nail fashion preferences across spectrums of race/ethnicity, class, age, and especially ‘Afro-nail’ in order to further understanding concerning nail beautification work. Empirical evidence suggests that fashions in nail styles vary according to race and class and that these same factors are at work in assigning value to particular expressions of style.",1433
2024,Topic Analysis of Long-term Care Management: A Text Mining Study,"Purpose: This study employed text mining methodologies to analyze research trends in elderly long-term care facility management, with the aim of identifying significant keywords and research topics to inform future research directions. Methods: We analyzed 10,487 articles published through April 2024, collected from major academic databases. The analysis incorporated text mining techniques such as term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), topic modeling, and social network analysis to extract meaningful patterns and themes from the literature. Results: Publication trends showed consistent growth since the 1980s, with significant acceleration in the 2020s. The analysis revealed that terms such as ‘care,’ ‘management,’ ‘nurse,’ and ‘patient’ were fundamental to the field. Three primary research themes emerged: “Healthcare Management and Quality Improvement,” “Strategic Management in Nursing and Community Care,” and “Health Services and Dementia Care.” These findings highlight the necessity for increased empirical and interdisciplinary research approaches. Conclusion: The findings emphasize the critical need for enhanced management competency programs within long-term care facilities. This study presents a comprehensive overview of current research developments and provides evidence-based recommendations for future research initiatives aimed at enhancing care quality and management practices in response to the challenges of an aging society.",1472
2024,A Study on the Utilization of Preferential Tariffs in the Korea-ASEAN FTA,"Research Purpose: At a time when the utilization of FTA ​​is being emphasized more due to the increase in purchasing power in Southeast Asian countries, the recent Tax Tribunal's FTA Special Act-related trial request cases are showing an increase in cases where the application of the agreement tariff rate is excluded due to failure to meet the origin criteria and requirements in relation to the application of special tariff treatment. Accordingly, it is necessary to examine related issues and suggest ways for Korean companies to strategically utilize the Korea-ASEAN FTA. The purpose of this study is to explore ways to increase the utilization of the Korea-ASEAN FTA by analyzing various cases based on the decision on the origin of the issue classification among the Korea Customs Service case cases and suggesting practical implications.
Research Methods: This study examined the precedents of the Tax Tribunal related to the Korea-ASEAN FTA.
Results in Research: To apply the preferential tariffs of the FTA, importers must meticulously verify the validity of the origin and avoid arbitrary interpretation and judgment of the FTA memorandum of understanding and related agreements.
Research Conclusion: While research related to the Korea-ASEAN FTA has been conducted, there has been a lack of studies on the exclusion of agreement tariff application. This study is significant in that it examined the precedents of the Tax Tribunal regarding this issue.",1464
2024,Research on the Application of Legal Personality Denial System to Actual Controller,"The internal governance structure of modern Chinese companies is becoming more and more complicated, the actual controller is gradually becoming the core of corporate governance, and the abuse of control power is also common. In view of the prominent problem that the actual controller abuses the controlling position to infringe the rights and interests of the company and minority shareholders in practice, Article 20 of the Company Law limits the application object of the legal personality denial system to the scope of shareholders, and paragraph 1, Article 23 of the new Company Law (revised in 2023), which is about to take effect, continues this scope, and its liability object is the company and minority shareholders. At present, the legislation has not made it clear that the legal personality denial system can be applied to the actual controller of non-shareholders.
In judicial practice, some courts, in order to protect the interests of the company and creditors, have decided to apply the denial of legal personality to the actual controller of non-shareholders in individual cases, which has been in the forefront of legislation, but such judgments have also been questioned as an analogy interpretation law. In market economic activities, companies, especially small, medium and micro companies, in the process of operation, the actual controller takes advantage of the control position, interferes with the company's operation, and damages the interests of the company and creditors. It cannot be effectively regulated before entering liquidation proceedings. Based on this, the connotation of the actual controller is clearly defined in the legislation, and the situation of the actual controller applying the denial of the personality of the legal person is classified according to the legislative style of the shareholder applying the denial of the personality of the legal person. At the same time, the fiduciary duty is extended to the actual controller. Strengthen the constraints on the actual controller to regulate its participation in the market economic activities on the principle of honesty and credit. We should further promote legislative and judicial improvement, optimize the business environment, and stimulate market vitality.",2264
2024,Literature Review Study on Semi-Permanent Tattoo Makeup Preferred by Customers,"Semi-permanent tattooing refers to the act of inserting pigment into the dermal layer of the skin by inserting pigment into the tip of a needle. Semi-permanent tattoos are often made to look like makeup is applied and are done to cover eyebrows, eyeliner, lips, body scars, and scalp. Semi-permanent tattooing is a form of tattooing because pigment is inserted directly into the dermal layer of the skin using a needle. Facial cosmetic and medical tattooing shares certain types and spectrum, both technically and clinically, with tattoos performed on other parts of the body. Many people around the world have semi-permanent tattoos, and semi-permanent tattoos are becoming increasingly common and growing exponentially in popularity. Additionally, semi-permanent tattoos are gradually moving from the outskirts of society to the mainstream. This study focuses on issues related to this practice. This study analyzed scientific reports and articles from well-known journals, related reviews and research publications in PubMed and Google Scholar from 1990 to 2023, and compiled the available research literature using Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed databases. Keywords such as semi-permanent tattoos, tattoo makeup, tattoo area, preferred customer, legal regulations and psychological aspects of tattoos were used in the search for publications.",1349

2024,Research on the Coupling Coordinated Development Evaluation of Digital Finance and Industrial Structure Upgrading,"In the context of high-quality economic development, the deep integration of the financial industry empowered by digital technology and industrial structure upgrading has become a focus. The article uses the entropy weight method and panel data from 31 provinces and cities in China from 2011 to 2021 to calculate the level of digital finance development and industrial structure upgrading in China. Then, the coupling coordination degree model is used to analyze the degree of coupling coordination development between the two. Of course, this also includes the differences in coupling coordination in different regions. The measurement results of development level show that the development level of digital finance in China has exceeded 0.8, maintaining a relatively high level. On the contrary, due to the long-term lag in industrial development, the level of industrial structure upgrading is relatively low, maintained at around 0.45. Secondly, due to the significant differences in economic development levels, there is also a situation where the level of digital finance development and industrial structure upgrading between regions are strong in the east, stable in the middle, and weak in the west. In addition, the measurement results of the coupling coordination model of the two systems show that the coupling degree between China’s digital finance and industrial structure upgrading is in the under coupling stage, the coordination degree is in the benign coordination stage, and the coupling coordination degree is at the primary coordination level. Secondly, consistent with the level of development of digital finance and industrial structure upgrading, the coupled coordination model also exhibits a clear regional heterogeneity trend, which is manifested as the result of strong in the east, stable in the middle, and weak in the west. Finally, based on the above conclusions, it is proposed to vigorously develop digital technology, promote the coupling coordinated development of digital finance and industrial structure upgrading, and provide constructive policy suggestions for achieving high-quality development of the Chinese economy.",2160
2024,A Study on the Structure of Enhancing Positive User Experience in Product Design,"With the passage of time and advancements in technology, user demands for products have evolved beyond mere functionality and aesthetic design to encompass deeper emotional and psychological needs.
However, traditional product design often prioritizes aesthetic form, frequently neglecting the diversity and complexity of user experiences. Therefore, this study aims to overcome these limitations and identify key factors that can effectively enhance user positive experiences. Although modern user choices appear primarily influenced by culture, they are closely tied to the motivations of our ancestors in the decision-making process. To address this, the study employs a mixed-methodology that combines experimental methods with literature review.
First, consumers from China and South Korea were selected as the primary research group, and anecdotal memories related to positive experiences were collected from 483 participants. Text mining techniques, including centrality analysis and CONCOR analysis, were subsequently applied to the collected memories related to user positive experiences, resulting in groups derived from word relationship patterns. The grouping results were then analyzed using the Fundamental Motives Framework from evolutionary psychology (Kenrick et al., 2010), identifying the motivational bases that elicit user positive experiences. Based on these findings, implementation strategies for product design were proposed, and the validity of the research results was confirmed through case analysis.
The results indicate that four factors can effectively enhance user positive experiences: establishing and strengthening social relationships, self-development, enhancing predictive potential through multisensory experiences and promoting exploration, restoration and regulation. Finally, this study focused on products that have a profound impact on users’ daily lives, selecting mobile phones as the subject of analysis. The validity of the research findings was verified through surveys and case studies of various mobile phone brands.
Through these efforts, each brand established design directions to enhance user positive experiences, thereby better meeting user needs and increasing market competitiveness and user loyalty. This research is expected to provide valuable references for future development and exploration processes aimed at optimizing user positive experiences in product design.",2430
2024,A Study on Cluster Behavior by Company Size in the Korean Stock Market,"Herding behavior refers to a phenomenon in which certain stocks or assets show similar characteristics or tend to move together in the stock market, which can often occur in similar industries, sectors, and investor groups. In this study, we analyzed whether herding behavior occurred among stocks listed on the stock market from August 2018 to November 2021, and divided the size of stocks by market capitalization to find out the difference in the degree of herding behavior depending on the size of the company. The results showed that there was no significant clustering behavior for large, mid, and small-cap stocks.
However, the clustering analysis shows that the clustering of large-cap stocks in market capitalization is weaker than the clustering of mid-cap and small-cap stocks. In addition, the cross-sectional scatterplot is reduced when market returns are extremely high or low, suggesting a new characteristic of clustering.",938
2024,A Study on the Impact of Overseas K-pop Users on the Export of Korean Cultural Products,"The study analyzes the purchase intentions of overseas Hallyu (Korean Wave) consumers and their impact on exports using survey data and export data from 2013 to 2021 in nine countries. We investigate consumer intentions to purchase Korean products such as cosmetics, smartphones, and clothing, especially when foreign consumers associate K-pop-related items with their initial perceptions of Korea. It analyzes respondents by age, education level, and gender, and the overall intent-to-purchase results are positive. We also look at whether geographical proximity affects purchase intentions. The results show that the overall purchasing intention of Asian countries is high, but a positive increase in overall purchasing inclination is observed across both Asian and non-Asian nations. In the analysis of export impact, increased recognition of K-pop has a positive effect not only on the export of culture-related products but also on non-culture-related products. Consequently, with the heightened recognition of K-pop as a form of soft power, its positive influence increases Korean cultural product purchase intention and also impacts the export of non-cultural products.",1176

2024,Supply-chain Inventory Management with Behavioral Consideration,"We develop inventory control strategies for a supplier who is selling a product to a group of newsvendors.
Recent research in newsvendor experiments using human subjects revealed significant behavioral tendencies in the decision making processes for inventory management. If the supplier would incorporate these behavioral tendencies while managing her inventories, her costs would be significantly reduced.
Using data from experiments, we estimate the possible reductions in supplier costs and determine the factors that significantly impact it. We observe a significant improvement in the supplier’s inventory decision if she estimates the demand distribution with a model that captures the anchoring tendencies instead of assuming aggregate randomness. As the model selection relies much on the data, it is an important task to determine whether the retailers are mean-anchoring, demand-chasing, both, or neither.
In addition, we observe that the information about retailers’ behaviors is more beneficial for the supplier when the end-customer demands are more variable. It is certain that more precise information on the data will lead to a better inventory decision for suppliers. The information includes the retailers’ behavioral tendencies, individual-specific order behaviors, and the variability of end-customer demands.",1330
2024,Augmented Reality Based Information Systems: An Exploratory Study of Understanding Children’s Perception,"Augmented Reality (AR) is a mix of the real world that is enhanced by virtual objects from computer-generated information. AR is currently used in a variety of information systems and library services. AR technologies are also being developed for today’s children, who are digital natives and are exposed to various technologies even earlier. To assist librarians who need to accurately understand users’ information needs and perceptions of the technology being used in their libraries, we conducted a study of AR perceptions among children. We conducted two online co-design sessions using “Would you rather?”, a co-design technique that facilitates research into children’s opinions. Through the co-design sessions, we found that children were psychologically wary about AR technology due to a lack of trust in the technology, and realism had a significant impact on these judgments. We also identified that children considered AR technology environments as an extension of the real world. Their real-world values directly influenced their perceptions of AR. This research provides insights into the wariness that libraries need to be aware of when developing AR content for children in the future, and how libraries can use AR as an educational tool.",1254
2024,A Study on Cohort Effects of Unification Consciousness of South Korean,"The recent trend of declining consciousness regarding the necessity of unification among South Korean citizens is evident. Does a cohort effect exist in this downward trend in the perception of the necessity of unification? The purpose of this study is to analyze whether birth cohorts statistically significantly influence the consciousness of the necessity of unification. To this end, the hierarchical age-period-cohort (HAPC) model was employed as the analytical model, and data from the Unification Consciousness Survey conducted by Seoul National University's Institute for Peace and Unification Studies from 2007 to 2021 was used. The analysis results showed evidence that the progress of economic inequality at the birth cohort level affected the decline in the perception of the necessity of unification. The 1980s birth cohort, which faced socioeconomic difficulties during their social advancement due to income and wealth polarization, is observed to have a distinctly negative perception of unification requiring massive financial resources, compared to the 1960s and 1970s birth cohorts.",1101
2024,Predicting Revenue Water Ratio using Multiple Linear Regression,"Water leakage can be estimated by various methods. Revenue water (RW) ratio is a significant index of water loss management in Korea. Existing methods of forecasting the RW ratio rely on local factors such as residual pressure, pipe length, service life, and leakage occurrence rate in the region. Because of the use of these regional factors, models used for the prediction of RW ratio are complicated and cannot be used for other areas. In this study, four effective factors were used as geospatial information for 41 cities in S. Korea to predict the RW ratio using simple factors in a quantitative analysis. The model for determining the relationship between the RW ratio and the four factors were evaluated through a correlation analysis and a multiple regression analysis using a statistical software (R). The result found that the RW ratio was strongly influenced by the water pressure, which depends on the elevation difference and geographical feature. The parameters for analysis were selected through the use of a prediction model for the RW ratio that applied elevation distribution, slope distribution, pipe distribution and population. The adjusted coefficient of determination (adj R2) was found to be 0.639, indicating that the model used to predict the RW ratio was efficient. This model can be efficiently used as a tool to implement the water loss reduction project in S. Korea.",1397
2024,中国合宪性审查制度的确立及实践应用研究,中国的宪法监督制度采用代议机关监督模式，因没有专门的审查机关，导致宪法监督制度长期没有发挥实效。经过多年的论证，中国明确将合宪性审查制度作为实现宪法监督的主要制度。2018年，中国修改宪法，将原有的全国人大专门委员会“法律委员会”更名为“宪法和法律委员会”，并赋予其合宪性审查的主要职责，拟以此推动合宪性审查。但五年来，合宪性审查制度的实践应用不尽人意。作为新的制度，事后合宪性审查仅作出8件，且均在初审阶段因国家机关之间通过协调解决问题而终止。在具体实践应用中发现了诸多问题，如在合宪性审查中发挥主要作用的主体并非是新设的宪法和法律委员会，而是作为全国人大常委会办事机构的法制工作委员会，在事后审查中宪法和法律委员会没有发挥应有的作用；审查对象中只包含各项法规、自治条例、单行条例和司法解释，未包含法律、规章及其他规范性文件，对相关规范性文件的合宪性审查缺乏程序保障；审查判断形式不统一，具有较大的任意性，不利于合宪性审查的规范性等问题。对此，本文提出建议明确落实宪法和法律委员会在合宪性审查中的审查主体地位，使宪法和法律委员会充分发挥合宪性审查职能；将法律、规章及其他规范性文件明确纳入全国人大常委会备案审查的范围内，为对其进行合宪性审查提供程序保障；采用“限定合宪”的审查判断方式，规范合宪性审查，以此推进中国合宪性审查制度的有效应用。,571
2024,Lending Behaviors of Prudent Banks around the 2008 Financial Crisis,"Before the 2008 crisis, risky banks had higher lending ratios, whereas prudent banks, characterized by high capital ratios, robust core deposit ratios, and low non-performing loan (NPL) ratios, exhibited higher excess loan growth rates. This trend was particularly notable in the context of secured real estate and household loans. Prudent banks also approved more mortgage applications than their risky counterparts. However, this proactive lending approach by prudent banks resulted in higher NPL ratios and lower profitability over time. Analyses using a prudence index confirmed these findings, indicating that prudent banks demonstrated excessive loan growth and risk-taking before the 2008 financial crisis.",713

Research Conclusion: In the China's stock market, there was a correlation between Price-Book Ratio (PB), company size (Size), and leverage (Lv) with stock prices. These findings provide important references for international investors interested in the China's stock market and offer insights for other global markets.",1280
2024,汉韩动作动词词义对比研究 -以“开”和“열다”为例,"An examination of Chinese language acquisition errors among Korean students has revealed that they often transfer the semantic and usage characteristics of the Korean verb “열다” into the Chinese verb “开”, leading to misapplication of the latter. This article refers to <표준국어대사전> (Standard Korean Language Dictionary) and ≪现代汉语词典≫ (Modern Chinese Dictionary) to compare and analyze the semantics of “열다” and “开” across displacement, initiation, and production meanings. In terms of displacement, “열다” primarily encompasses the basic action of “opening,” whereas “开” extends to opening, separating, starting, leaving, becoming known, and dividing. For initiation meanings, both verbs share semantics related to the start of events, but “开” also includes the lifting of prohibitions. Regarding production meanings, both can signify a shop opening, with “열다” also involving the creation of abstract concepts such as establishing diplomatic relations and new beginnings, while “开” emphasizes the emergence of basic entities, such as clearing a path or issuing documents. The article identifies semantic correspondences between “열다” and “开,” providing insights for designing Korean-Chinese language instruction.
In addition, the article illustrates the respective motion diagrams for the words “开” and “열다” based on their semantic characteristics. In language teaching, teachers can use intuitive images to explain the meanings of words, reducing the vocabulary memorization burden for students. It may be advantageous for future comparative studies of “开” and “열다” to incorporate native language corpora, allowing for a nuanced exploration of their commonalities and differences within specific contexts.",1698
2024,Research on Student Perception and Demand for Improving Extracurricular Curriculum,"(Purpose) This study aimed to investigate the perceptions, satisfaction, and requirements of program participants in order to effectively operate a voluntary participation-based extracurricular program.
(Design/methodology/approach) This study were students from D University, a four-year university in the Seoul metropolitan area, who participated in extracurricular programs related to local content and local creators, as well as local community residents. The survey was conducted online for approximately two weeks from May 20, 2024, to June 2, 2024. A total of 113 responses were collected, with 112 valid responses used for statistical processing after one invalid response was excluded. The statistical processing of the collected questionnaires was performed using SPSS 22.0 Korean version after data coding.
(Findings) The survey highlights several key points: first, insufficient awareness and promotion of local content-related extracurricular programs among students; second, the importance of tailoring program content to enhance motivation for participation; third, the need for diverse participation options to accommodate students' schedules; and fourth, suggestions for improving operational efficiency and information provision within the programs.
(Research implications or Originality) The limitations of ths study include the lack of significant differences observed in the analysis of grade level, gender, and department regarding the extracurricular program. Therefore, conducting further research to analyze the effectiveness of administration and program development based on differences in grade, major or department, and individual background variables will provide greater significance in understanding students' perceptions and demands for extracurricular education.",1796
2024,Study on the Electron Beam Repair Welding of 5000 Aluminum Alloys,"Electron beam welding (EBW) has been attracted due to its high energy density, high depth-to-width ratio, low thermal strain, compared with arc and laser welding. In addition, it ensures high quality weld joint in structural metals in a wide range of thickness from 0.025 mm to 300 mm. Therefore, EBW is widely used in industries such as automotive, aviation, nuclear power plant, etc. Although a lot of studies on EBW for several decades have been presented, EB based repair welding with supplement of filler metal has less reported. In this work, EB repair welding for 5083 aluminum alloys was investigated because the aluminum alloys are becoming more important as a lightweight material in mobility industries. Material characterization and mechanical properties of the repair-welded specimens were evaluated, compared with characteristics of base metal and bead welding without repair. The optimized experimental conditions showed tensile strength of 294 MPa, which is a similar to base metal. Our study indicates that EB repair welding can be considered for the candidate of repair welding of aluminum alloys.",1115

2024,Conceptualizing Intercultural Urban Heritage in the Age of K-Diaspora,"Conventionally, heritage including monuments are often mobilized to represent the identity of and the sense of place and belong to a nation-state. The so-called “authorized heritage discourse” defines heritage as not only predominantly material but as those objects that speak to national identity emphasizing the great and the good in an attempt to create an illusion that the nation-state and its heritage are inherent and immutable. However, heritage is now recognized as being contested and has been re-theorized as practices of performances where the past is mobilized in the present to address contemporary social and political issues centered on claims to identity and sense of place.
This paper is a theoretical inquiry into conceptualizing intercultural urban heritage in the age of K-Diaspora to propose the promotion and inclusion of urban heritage for migrants into the national, regional, and local (urban) heritage system of South Korea. To do so, this paper first examines the change in the discourses of the Korean diaspora due to global polycrisis and argues for a more open and fluid concept of the K-diaspora. Secondly, this paper discusses critical heritage studies and urban memory and explains why urban heritage closely linked to urban memory needs to expand to include all city residents who are migrants in a broad sense of the word for social integration of the city and the realization of urban citizenship. Lastly, this paper presents examples and initiatives related to intercultural urban heritage within South Korea and abroad in the hope of promoting the intercultural cities program.",1616
2024,Characterization of Bond Mechanism between Concrete and Cabon Fiber Reinforced Polymer Grids: Experimental Study,"Corrosion of steel rebar reduces the lifespans of conventional reinforced concrete structures. In contrast, carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) materials are preferable due to their noncorroding properties and high strength-to-weight ratio. In the present study, the bonding of CFRP grids to concrete was evaluated for their use in different structural applications, and pull-out tests were conducted on 30 fabricated specimens with different embedded lengths. Results reveal that failure load increases with bond length, although not in a directly proportional manner.
Based on empirical data, an equation representing the relationship between the characteristic strength of CFRP grids and their embedded length was formulated. This equation serves as a valuable tool to determine the development length required for CFRP grids in concrete, offering insights into the feasibility of utilizing CFRP grids as reinforcement elements in concrete structures.",957

2024,A Study on Korean Diaspora and Population: 1910-2019 and into the Future,"A population is usually defined as the number of people living in a territory, which is the basis of a nation. In some countries, including Korea, however, people tend to equate nationality with membership in a single, homogeneous ethnic group (Han-minjok in Korean), which are viewed as important elements of their identity. Hence, this study tries to estimate the Korean population dynamics based on ethnicity rather than geographic territory. This study focuses on the dynamics of Han-minjok in terms of ethnic identity, although most previous literature mainly focuses on the population living on the Korean Peninsula or Korean immigrants to a certain country. By utilizing historical census data sets, historical records, administrative data, and statistical projections, this study encompasses the size, structure, and distribution of the ethnic Korean populations as well as spatial or temporal changes in them since the early 20th century.",947
2024,Research on the Inheritance and Design of Madam Xian's Cultural Heritage in Social Innovation,"With the rapid development of globalization and informatization, human society is undergoing significant transformation. This transformation not only affects human survival, production, and lifestyle but also prompts profound reflections on social, economic, cultural, and environmental aspects. Achieving a balance between social, economic, and environmental benefits on the basis of economic development, while promoting traditional culture and improving people's quality of life, has become a pressing issue.
In 2003, UNESCO adopted the Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, establishing ""revitalization"" and ""re-creation"" as core goals of intangible cultural heritage (ICH) protection. Since the Chinese State Council announced the first batch of national representative ICH projects in 2006, the interest in ICH has continuously increased. Government efforts to protect and transmit ICH have intensified, academic attention has risen, and public enthusiasm has surged. This has led to the integration of ICH into the participation of multiple stakeholders, including government, researchers, modern design and art practitioners, cultural tourism operators, and consumers. It has also fostered the development of cultural and creative design and social innovation.
In the context of rapid global information exchange, the inheritance and innovation of ICH face unprecedented opportunities and challenges. While the uniqueness and diversity of ICH offer infinite potential for innovation, the global cultural exchange requires joint efforts from government, academia, design and art practitioners, cultural tourism operators, and consumers to achieve balanced growth in social, economic, and environmental benefits, thereby enhancing people's quality of life.
Madam Xian's culture, an influential ICH in Guangdong and Hainan provinces, serves as the research subject. The author employed various research methods, including literature review, case analysis, comparative analysis, network analysis, and social surveys, to deeply explore the core values of inheriting and innovating Madam Xian's culture in social innovation. Elements and structures of inheritance and innovative design were extracted.
Combining theory with practice, the research outcomes were applied in organizational practices in Gaozhou, Maoming, the birthplace of Madam Xian's culture in the Lingnan region of Guangdong, with a focus on cultural products and story illustrations designed for the ""Z Generation."" Based on this research, this paper takes Madam Xian's culture as an example to explore the development status and trends of cultural and creative design and social innovation from the perspectives of East and West. It aims to provide new perspectives, ideas, and methods for the inheritance and innovative design of ICH and its modern value transformation.",2869

2024,A Study on the Possibility of Introducing a Breakdown Divorce System,"The purpose of this study is to present reasonable legislative measures such asacknowledging divorce claims for spouses with fault and establishing new separation clauseswhen introducing the Breakdownism divorce system. Korea's divorce law has been based onliabilityism as a major principle for the purpose of preventing a husband from unilaterallykicking out his wife and protecting the socially disadvantaged. However, advanced countrieshave already widely adopted liabilityism and other Breakdownism in divorce, and the reviewof the introduction of Breakdownism began in earnest as the awareness that continuingmarriage due to the improvement of the social status of Korean women and the right topursue happiness recognized in Article 10 of the Constitution has improved. Some are criticalof Breakdownism, which is a social issue, that there is a problem with promoting familybreakdown and not holding the spouse responsible for the marriage breakdown. However, onAugust 19, 2021, the Supreme Court actually took the position of Breakdownism as acceptingthe divorce request from the spouse responsible. Therefore, this study reviewed the contentsof the Breakdownism divorce system and each country's Breakdownism divorce laws, andderived and presented legislative bills that are reasonable and protect the rights and interestsof the parties because introducing Breakdownism without any countermeasures has a greatimpact on our society.",1438
2024,Exploring Korean University Students' Perceptions of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Education,"In today's world, having knowledge and skills related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) is essential for diverse university students. As a result, many Korean universities offer AI-related courses as part of their mandatory curriculum. However, designing an AI curriculum that caters to university students requires considering the previous experiences and perspectives of AI convergence education.

2024,"The Development of the Role of the Holy Spirit in Sanctification in the Seventh-day Adventist Church, 1877-1914","This study aims to explore the role of the Holy Spirit in sanctification as viewed by selected authors in the context of the changing perspectives on the personality of the Holy Spirit within the Seventh-day Adventist Church. It seeks to identify differences and historical developments between Trinitarians and anti-Trinitarians. Specifically, the study examines the writings of J. H. Waggoner, who authored works on the Holy Spirit during the predominance of anti-Trinitarianism prior to the 1880s; Ellen G. White, who emphasized the personality of the Holy Spirit and sanctification during the 1890s, a period when writings on the Trinity began to emerge; and G. B. Thompson, who, during a time when Trinitarianism had gained broader acceptance, clearly articulated the personality and work of the Holy Spirit. The findings reveal that the acceptance of the personality of the Holy Spirit is closely connected with His sanctifying role. While anti-Trinitarian thought acknowledges the functional role of the Spirit in sanctification, it lacks an emphasis on deep interpersonal interaction. In contrast, the acceptance of the Spirit's personhood not only highlights such interactions but also places greater emphasis on sanctification. The writings of these three authors from the 1880s to the 1910s demonstrate the transition in perspectives on the Holy Spirit over time and significantly contributed to the Adventist understanding of the Trinity and the role of the Holy Spirit.",1482

In non-face-to-face broadcasting and performances, there are concerns about discrepancies with the live experience and the inability to select scenes of interest. In the case of non-face-to-face lectures, there is a phenomenon of losing concentration and interest in the non-stop environment, leading to the emergence of the term ""Zoom Fatigue."" As such, with the normalization of changes brought about by COVID-19, some predict that human history will be divided into ""Before Corona"" (BC) and ""After Corona"" (AC). Amidst the significant transformations in politics, economy, society, culture, education, and all other areas of human life due to COVID-19, the most significant change is the minimization of physical contact, leading to the widespread adoption of Untact culture.",1550
2024,Calculating Activation Energy of Phthalonitrile Using the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa Equation,"This study employed the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa method to determine the activation energy (Ea) of phthalonitrile (PN) synthesized with varying concentrations of a sulfur-containing curing agent. The synthesis process, characterized by various routes differing in curing times and temperatures, revealed that an optimal balanceis critical for ideal thermal characteristics. It was observed that a 15% concentration of the curing agent offered the highest thermal stability. However, the proportion of sulfur content did not directly correlate with the applied proportion of curing agents, hinting at uneven mixing during the process. Despite this, the experimental results underscore the importance of fine-tuning the curing parameters for optimal synthetic outcomes. Lastly, an elevatedEa was in a direct correlation with the dosage amount of curing agents which confirmed their enhanced thermalstability.",898
2024,金景善筆下的北京形象研究,"道光年間, 來訪的朝鲜使臣或多或少地受到“北學論”的影響, 他們減弱了對清朝的敵視, 主張學習先進的科學技術從而改善朝鮮的民生｡ 而且, 西方科學技術和文化也陸續地傳入到中國｡ 與以往的朝鮮使臣相比, 道光朝的朝鮮使臣的國際視域更為寬廣, 他們能夠在更加多元的文化環境中審視清朝和自身｡ 道光十二年(1832年), 金景善作為書狀官出使中國, 將他在中國的所見所聞結集為≪燕轅直指≫｡ 金景善以敏銳的觀察力和深邃的洞察力, 為我們描寫了道光年間北京的真實風貌, 具有較高的研究價值｡ 金景善筆下的北京形象, 主要有以下几个方面：首先是氣勢恢宏的北京城｡ 文化昌盛、歷史悠久, 不失皇都的風範｡ 其次是東西交匯的社會｡ 在北京城里居住着各國的使臣, 各種文化在這裏交匯碰撞, 但是囿於時代的局限, 金景善對於西方科學知識的接受仍停留在器物層面, 他未能意識到世界巨變即將到來, 令人惋惜｡ 其三是繁華尚奢的市肆｡ 金景善笔下的市肆呈现出狂歡的景象: 物阜民豐, 貨物繁多, 貿易發達、順暢, 人民安居樂業, 生活富足｡ 但在這浮華的背後隱藏的是尚奢成風、滿漢矛盾不可調合的危機, 揭示了清朝走向衰落的必然性｡ 其四是壯麗宏侈的景觀｡ 金景善一方面讚賞景觀的壯麗之美, 並欣羡背後蘊含的強大國力和高超技藝; 另一方面卻對建造這些景觀的統治者給予勞民傷財的評價｡ 這種矛盾的態度, 正是金景善在“華夷之辨”和“北學中國”兩種對華觀之間搖擺不定的表現, 這也是道光朝時期朝鮮使臣試圖將清朝高超技藝與“蠻夷”文明分離的普遍認知｡",659
2024,Analysis on Solutions to Common-Pool Resource Dilemmas in the Defense Sector,"ABSTRACT This study aims to systematically analyze Common-Pool Resource issues in the defense sector and propose effective solutions for addressing them. Common-Pool Resource problems can lead to inefficient use and waste of resources. To address these issues, the study proposes the Stackelberg Incentive approach and the Shapley Value method. The Stackelberg Incentive approach offers a way to control resource consumption through policy measures to prevent inefficiencies, while the Shapley Value method provides a fair distribution of resources based on contributions in a collaborative environment. The study examines these approaches through case studies on power requirements determination, food budgeting and mess hall operations, and training budget usage, discussing the applicability of each method. The findings confirm that both approaches can contribute to the efficient use and fair allocation of defense resources, and that policy adjustments and collaborative strategies can maximize overall organizational efficiency. The study provides practical policy recommendations for managing Common-Pool Resources and emphasizes the need for future research to assess the effectiveness of the proposed solutions through empirical data and various case studies.",1269

2024,A Study on Financial Performance of Non-life Insurance Industry in Japan,"This study examines financial performance of the Japanese non-life insurance industry comparing USA and Korean non-life insurance industry by using the A.M. Best’s rating technique. We also aim to contribute to an improved understanding of the relationship between growth, efficiency, profitability, safety, and liquidity in Japanese non-life insurance industry. We conduct factor analysis to measure the validity of key variable factors of property-liability insurers in Japan, USA, and Korean for the 2010 to 2019 time period. After factor analysis, we also calculate total score of each non-life insurance industry and compare total scores without weighting value by using principal component analysis. Also, we analyze the relationship among these variables and the interdependence between profitability and safety by using a multiple linear regression analysis. Three findings are highlighted as follow: First, the correlation coefficient in the Japan general insurance industry represents the linear relationship between variables. It can be seen that profitability has a positive relationship with growth of the premium, asset size of the Japanese non-life insurance industry, and liquidity and it has a negative relationship with safety and efficiency. The highest correlation among the variables occurs between profitability and safety because less profitable insurers are more willings to take risks. Second, there is strong relationship between profitability and safety, which is signifiant at 0.01 level in the Japan general insurance industry. We conclude that insurers with a higher solvency ratio should show a better profitability than other peers. Finally, Japan non-life insurance has good level of efficiency, safety, and liquidity, the growth and profit performance shows the margin(below) of average level, it should improve profitability and growth areas in order to take comparative advantages in a competitive global general insurance industry.",1968

2024,A study on Affordance Design Elements - Case Study on Metaverse University Campuses -,"(Background and Purpose) The COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of the metaverse have encouraged universities to operate virtual campuses and conduct major events online. This digital transition, an attempt to replicate the real college experience in virtual spaces, encompasses several challenges, including user interface (UI), user experience (UX), and interaction issues. Advancements in technology and the development of user-centric guidelines are necessary to address these issues . Moreover, affordance design theory can play a crucial role in developing effective implementation and operation strategies for virtual university campuses. This study aims to evaluate the affordance design elements using case studies of metaverse university campuses, providing guidelines for the development of metaverse-based university campuses. (Method) First, affordance was understood by reviewing existing studies, and affordance design elements were derived according to Rex Hartson's classification system of affordances. Second, the definition and components of the metaverse were specified to elucidate its characteristics, and the design elements of metaverse affordances were identified by linking the characteristics of the metaverse with Rex Hartson's concept of affordance. Third, the concept and application methods of the metaverse university campus were examined, and campus cases implemented on various platforms were selected. Conclusions were drawn using case analysis based on 20 evaluation items. (Results) The analysis of cases implemented across various platforms suggests that the characteristics of each platform and differences in user mechanisms significantly influenced the outcomes. Case 3, implemented in ZEP, and Case 4, implemented in U-verse, demonstrated high relevance in 14 and 15 out of 20 affordance design element evaluation criteria, respectively. In contrast, Case 1, implemented in a proprietary platform, and Case 2, implemented in Roblox, demonstrated high relevance in only 4 and 2 criteria, respectively, indicating a significant gap. Cases 3 and 4 received high ratings in the affordance design element evaluation, whereas Case 1 received a moderate rating, and Case 2 received the lowest rating. These results were analyzed to stem from differences in platform characteristics and user interaction. (Conclusion) The design and implementation of metaverse university campuses demonstrate that elements such as user experience, interface, and virtual environment composition vary significantly depending on the platform environment. This underscores the importance of content development for continuous communication and information activation within metaverse platforms and university campuses. The development of a user-centered virtual educational environment using the application of affordance design is anticipated, and it is expected to contribute to the creation of an effective learning environment.",2943
2024,Risk Factors of Aspiration in Pediatric Dysphagia: A Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study Analysis,"Objectives: This study examined to identify effective temporal measures to distinguish between aspirators and non-aspirators in young children with dysphagia. Methods: Fortytwo children aged from 1 year to 3 years 11 months were included in this study. All children were referred to Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS) at a tertiary hospital in South Korea. The children were divided into two groups depending on the presence of aspiration: aspirators (N = 16) and non-aspirators (N = 26). Seven temporal measures were measured to identify swallowing physiologies by using frame-by-frame analysis. A multilevel model with binomial distribution was used to examine which temporal measures better predict group membership. Results: Delayed pharyngeal swallow (DPS), pharyngeal transit time (PTT), and initiation of laryngeal closure (ILC) were significant factors in distinguishing the aspirators from the non-aspirators. DPS was the most useful temporal measure to distinguish between the groups. ILC placed second, followed by PTT. A model including DPS and PTT was the best model to predict the group membership. A model with PTT and ILC ranked second. Conclusion: The findings indicated that an aspiration risk appeared to increase when the bolus stayed longer in the pharynx and initiation of pharyngeal swallow was delayed. Also, the bolus remained in the pharynx for an abnormally longer time while the airway was open in the aspirators. This study suggests that clinicians should not only recognize pathophysiological factors that may increase the aspiration risk but also determine which abnormal physiology is a main factor of aspiration during VFSS.",1664

2024,A Defensive Normative Power: A Study on EU's Strategic Autonomy Capacity,"When Ursula von der Leyen took office as the President of the European Commission in 2019, she declared that il will be a “Geopolitical Commission” under her lead, pointing out the reality that the EU cannot stay outside of the geopolitical tension of the 21st century, and affirming that the normative power will join the geopolitical game. Whether it is establishing a stronger military defence system or introducing more diverse trade defence instruments, a “defensive” EU is undoubtedly taking shape. But are defensive foreign policy and normative power compatible? How will the defensive EU adjust its foreign policy in terms of military and economic aspects? These are the first set of questions to be answered in this paper. Secondly, this paper will turn its focus on the three major powers in international relations today, namely the United States, China, and European Union. As the EU strongly aspires to acquire strategic autonomy since 2017, this project would analyze how the EU is forming a normative agenda for a defensive Europe in terms of its military and economic foreign policy, and whether it has the capacity to achieve the goal of strategic balance with the United States and China. The paper manifests that indeed, a large part of the disputes that the EU has encountered with the US and China in recent years comes from the shift in the EU’s foreign policy direction. And the EU sure has the interests and needs to ensure its strategic autonomy when finding its position in the US-China competition.",1525
2024,A Study on the Application of Visual Thinking in Optimizing Chinese Character Writing Instruction for Elementary Students,"In traditional elementary school writing instruction, conventional methods often overemphasize formal regularity of writing, neglecting students’ in-depth understanding of character structure and personalized learning needs. This can, to some extent, suppress students’ interest in learning and the improvement of their writing abilities. This study delves into the significance and practical application of visual thinking in writing instruction, proposing an innovative teaching strategy aimed at stimulating students’ visual cognition through graphical teaching methods, deepening understanding of the structure of Chinese characters, and enhancing student engagement through contextualized and interactive learning activities. The research begins by analyzing the important role of visual thinking in strengthening memory and optimizing visual representation, clarifying its value in the reform of traditional writing instruction. Subsequently, the study explores the design of teaching activities based on visual thinking through practical cases, examining how to effectively integrate them with writing skill training, and using gamified learning and teaching feedback mechanisms to further motivate and engage students. A series of teaching experiments were conducted, gathering and analyzing data on students’ writing abilities, engagement, and satisfaction with learning. The results indicate that the visual thinking strategy not only increased students’ interest in writing but also significantly improved their writing quality and learning efficiency. Compared with traditional teaching methods, the experimental group using visual thinking strategies showed significant advantages in writing skills, Chinese character memory, and creative expression. These outcomes not only confirm the effectiveness of visual thinking in Chinese character writing instruction but also provide new perspectives and methods for future language teaching. Additionally, the study explores the correlation between visual thinking and student motivation and interest in learning, as well as its potential role in promoting independent learning.",2136
2024,International Migrant Workers in South Korea: Perceived Insider Status and Organizational Outcomes,"The growing number of non-traditional workers in the global labor market, such as temporary and part-time workers, has made this employment category an essential area of study. However, as a category of non-regular employees, foreign migrant workers with temporary work visas have received little attention. To examine this less-focused group, the study gathered data from international migrant workers in South Korea to understand their perceptions of their organizational membership status. Using quantitative research methods, the current study investigates what makes international migrant laborers in South Korea feel like ""insiders."" The inves- tigation used a questionnaire on 94 migrant workers to collect information via respondent-driven sampling (RDS). The level of perceived organizational support was a predictor of perceived insider status for international migrant employees, and it also worked as a mediator between perceived organizational support and organiza- tional citizenship behavior. Further findings from this study include the relationship between perceived insider status and organizational citizenship behavior, as well as the intention to continue with the same organization. This study will benefit researchers, managers, and policymakers in the long term because of its theoretical implications and managerial relevance.",1351

2024,Interrelationships in User Experiences and Perceived Risks : A Comparative Empirical Study of Products and Services,"This study addresses the convergence and shift from material to experiential consumption, highlighting the critical role of user experience (UX) in consumer satisfaction and business success.
While products and services differ in design and interaction, existing research on the interplay between UX and perceived risk is limited and often lacks a comprehensive approach. To fill this gap, the study proposes new hypotheses that explore the multidimensional nature of UX and its impact on perceived risk, focusing on the differences between products and services.
Using a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, including literature review, surveys and multiple regression analysis, the study uncovers key findings: (1) UX evaluation factors differ between products and services, with 12 common factors, but with products having unique factors such as multifunctionality and operability, and services having environment and professionalism. (2) Products generally score higher than services on Findability, Convenience and Assurance, but lower on Responsiveness and Sociality. (3) Consumers perceive less overall risk for products than for services. (4) Those with no prior experience perceive higher risk.
(5) Previous UX has a significant impact on perceived risk, more so for services than for products.
(6) Assurance for products and professionalism for services consistently reduce perceived risk, while attractiveness is key for both in reducing perceived risk.",1472
2024,Illegible Expression Methods in the Design Process of the Upcycled Product,"(Background and Purpose) Plastic waste or scrap metal thrown into the sea or land accumulates for decades, beginning to become a disaster for humans. To cope with this, the importance of utilizing recycled resources continues to increase, and much effort is being made to increase the recycling ratio. Most upcycle designs attempt product disassembly and reassembly for a new purpose. In the upcycle design process, the forms that appear while reassembling discarded products to suit the current purpose use expression methods that attract people's attention. From the illegible perspective, this study tried to find the expression methods. As upcycle design creates a new value by partially transforming the form of waste, research was conducted to find visual expression methods that add new values. (Method) As a research method, it was approached from the illegible perspective of design regarding the fact that objects are being sold at high prices with completely strange and new shapes and purposes without any major changes in form. Illegibility is difficult for people to understand, but methods such as visual camouflage and deception are used as ways to stimulate the other person's interest. In other words, the illegibility in this study is an important measure of design that reflects the emotions of the recipients who encounter the design and is a unique delivery technique used to stimulate the emotions and sensibilities of the recipients, and it is a method that induces curiosity & interest and leads to rethinking about the design. Accordingly, based on various upcycle design cases, it was analyzed how illegible expression methods are revealed in the product design, and then explored methods that are mainly used. (Results) As shown in the form of upcycled products, the most frequently used illegible expression methods were deceiving, hiding, and blending influenced the unique image-making of product design. However, in the case of some household goods, illegible design characteristics were hardly visible as the original shape was not maintained due to the harsh processing and washing of recycled materials. It means that the unique properties that can be revealed through the shape of the raw materials have disappeared as simplified designs are preferred when people wear or use them in daily life. (Conclusions) In upcycled product design, with the exception of some designs for household goods, illegible expression methods were mostly used, and among them, blending, deceiving, and hiding are used in large proportions. In the future, more specific research should be conducted in the area of product design development using illegibility as the expression methods can be mainly used in the process of developing upcycle design.",2764
2024,A Study on Factors Affecting the Regulatory Unit Price and Collection Amount of Long－term Repair Reserves,"[Purpose] The purpose of this study is to analyze the factors affecting the regulatory unit price and collection amount of long－term repair reserves, a category within apartment management fees, based on factors influencing the maintenance of multi－family housing. Additionally, the study seeks to identify the practical elements currently reflected in the determination of the regulatory unit price and collection amount. The findings aim to provide institutional, practical, and academic grounds for calculating the regulatory unit price in a lawful and reasonable manner.
[Methodology] The analysis utilized data extracted from external audit reports and information registered in the Apartment Management Information System from 2019 to 2022. Using multiple regression analysis, the study examined the relationship between factors influencing the maintenance of multi－family housing and both the regulatory unit price and the collection amount of long－term repair reserves.
[Findings] The results of the study are as follows：First, the elapsed months of the multi－family housing were not statistically significant in relation to the regulatory unit price but showed a positive (＋) correlation with the collection amount at the 1% significance level.
Second, the sale price of the multi－family housing was not statistically significant in relation to the regulatory unit price but showed a negative (－) correlation with the collection amount at the 10% significance level. Third, the management type of the multi－family housing was not statistically significant in relation to the regulatory unit price but showed a positive (＋) correlation with the collection amount at the 5% significance level. Forth, the building structure of the multi－family housing showed no statistically significant correlation with either the regulatory unit price or the collection amount. Fifth, the home network system of the multi－family housing was not statistically significant in relation to the regulatory unit price but showed a negative (－) correlation with the collection amount at the 5% significance level. In summary, while certain factors influencing the maintenance of multi－family housing are partially reflected in the collection amount of long－term repair reserves, these factors do not appear to influence the regulatory unit price.
[Implications] The findings suggest that factors affecting the maintenance of multi－family housing are reflected in the collection amount but not in the regulatory unit price of long－term repair reserves. These results raise questions about the effectiveness of the Apartment Management Act’s provisions regarding the accumulation rate. Therefore, institutional amendments, practical improvements, and academic research are required to ensure that the regulatory unit price adequately reflects the factors influencing the maintenance of multi－family housing.",2891
2024,A Legal Study on the Fair Competition of State-owned Capital Investment Policy in China,"On June 14, 2016, the State Council of China issued the Opinions on the Establishment of a Fair Competition Review System in the Construction of the Market System. This document holds landmark significance for fostering a fair and competitive market environment while ensuring that the market plays a decisive role in resource allocation. Subsequently, on October 23, 2017, the National Development and Reform Commission, along with five other departments, jointly released the Implementing Rules for the Fair Competition Review System (Provisional). This was followed by further developments leading to the issuance of comprehensive Implementing Rules for the Fair Competition Review System on July 8, 2021. These rules aimed to refine and enhance various aspects of the fair competition review system.Most recently, on June 6, 2024, China's State Council promulgated regulations titled Regulations on Fair Competition Review, presented as an administrative regulation. This initiative further clarified both the legal framework and implementation mechanisms associated with fair competition reviews.
The successive introduction of these policies underscores their critical importance and necessity in promoting effective fair competition review practices. China's state-owned capital investment policy plays a significant role in the allocation of social resources. However, if it does not adhere to market principles, it may lead to various anti-competitive harms. Given the unique characteristics of the state-owned capital investment policy, establishing a legal framework for fair competition review is particularly crucial. This paper draws on China's distinctive legal system and national conditions while incorporating advanced international experiences in competition review. It advocates for comprehensive improvements through legislative enhancement, administrative oversight, and judicial protection to ensure that the fair competition review system effectively constrains state-owned capital investment policies. The initiative not only facilitates the optimization of state-owned capital resource allocation and enhances the socialist market economic system with Chinese characteristics, but also addresses the concerns of the international community regarding China's state-owned capital policies. Furthermore, it offers a Chinese initiative for global governance of state-owned capital.",2403
2024,Research on Food Packaging Based on the Needs of Elderly People - Focused on the Chinese Consumer Market -,"This study explores the design of elderly-friendly food packaging within the context of China’s emerging new retail era, focusing on user needs to enhance the shopping experience for older consumers.
Packaging has historically ensured product stability, highlighted value, explained attributes, and conveyed information. The research employs a comprehensive methodology, including user questionnaires, observations, structured interviews, and the Kano model, to systematically analyze and categorize user needs, satisfaction, and dissatisfaction. Findings indicate that packaging design for the elderly should emphasize barrier-free access, safety, emotional resonance, and reusability to address the unique physiological and psychological characteristics of older adults. These considerations are crucial in mitigating the challenges faced by the elderly due to societal inadequacies in addressing their needs. The study concludes that understanding and integrating these specific user needs into packaging design can significantly improve the usability and appeal of food products for elderly consumers, thereby promoting sustainable and effective design practices in the retail industry.",1190

2024,Synthesis of Silicone-Acrylic Emulsions by ARGET ATRP Polymerization and Its Polymerization Kinetics,"Methyl methacrylate (MMA), ethyl acrylate (EA), butyl acrylate (BA) and isooctyl acrylate (2-EHA) were usedas the main monomers; γ-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane (KH-570) was used as the silicone functional monomer; a reactive emulsifier and sodium dodecyl sulfate were used as the composite emulsification system; ethyl 2-bromoisobutyrate (EBIB) was used as the initiator; and copper bromide was used as the catalyst. A silicone-acrylic emulsion was prepared by the activators regenerated by electron transfer-atom transfer radical polymerization (ARGET-ATRP) with 2-bipyridine as the ligand and ascorbic acid as the reducing agent. The effects of temperature, initiator, organosilicon and bipyridine on the reaction kinetics were studied, and the polymers were characterized by infrared spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. When the temperature increased, the conversion and the polymerization rate increased, and the apparent activation energy Ea was 79.65 kJ·mol-1. A greater initiator amount correlated to a higher conversion, a higher polymerization rate and a lower molecular weight. An increase in the amount of silicone increased the conversion and the reaction rate to 0.5% and 1%, respectively. With increasing silicone content, the gel content of the polymer, the molecular weight and PDI increased; when the silicone content was 4%, the polymer could not be dissolved by tetrahydrofuran. The characterization showed that MMA, EA, BA, 2-EHA, KH-570 and the reactive emulsifier SR-10 were all involved in the polymerization. ARGET-ATRP had a controllable molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution. Due to the addition amount and cost, few industrial applications exist. Therefore, in this study, the application of ARGET-ATRP on wood paint and the control of the molecular weight of the polymer to meet large-scale industrial application needs were examined.",1948
2024,Establishing Flood Risk Criteria for Vehicles based on Flood Damage Assessment,"Recent recurrent flooding and road flooding, driven by climate change, have been increasing both human casualties and quantitative losses to vehicles. While various studies have been conducted focusing on measures to prevent human casualties, research related to vehicles remains limited. This study aims to assess the economic losses to vehicles based on flood depth and propose flood risk criteria. Four types of vehicles were selected as the study subjects, and flood risk criteria were established using mechanical damage and flood damage costs for different flood depths. The analysis revealed that areas with a flood depth of 20 cm or more should be avoided, or vehicle entry should be restricted, to mitigate vehicle damage from flooding. It is expected that the flood risk criteria based on flood depth proposed in this study will be used in the future to establish vehicle traffic regulations and flood mitigation measures for roadways.",945

2024,Clinical Features of Molar Root-Incisor Malformation: A Retrospective Study,"This study aimed to identify the clinical characteristics of molar root-incisor malformation (MRIM) and provide clinical considerations for treatments.
Panoramic radiographs and electronic medical records of 64 patients with MRIM were retrospectively reviewed. Age, gender, follow-up period, medical history, complications, distribution of MRIM teeth, treatment, and prognosis were analyzed.
Females were affected 1.56 times more than males, and the average age was 8.2 years.
Dental complications, including periapical lesions, abscesses, and alveolar bone loss, were observed in 71.9%, and eruption disturbance of adjacent teeth was noticed in 37.5%. Most patients had medical histories in the first year of life. The most prevalent history was prematurity or low birthweight, followed by neurological conditions, surgeries, medications, and infections. All patients had MRIM on permanent first molars. The primary second molars were the second most frequently involved, followed by maxillary permanent central incisors and primary first molars. The prevalence was low on permanent lateral incisors and canines. Extraction was the most prevalent treatment done on MRIM-affected teeth, and most extraction sockets were managed by the eruption of permanent second molars. Few cases received endodontic treatment but with low success rates. Early detection of MRIM and prompt, appropriate treatment are important to avoid unnecessary discomfort from complications.",1463
2024,Investigating the Effects of Output and Opportunity for Modified Output on Second Language Learning,"The present study aimed to investigate the effects of output and the opportunity for modified output on second language (L2) learning. Forty-five intermediate-level Korean EFL learners participated in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to a control group (i.e., non-output group) or one of two experimental groups, which differed in whether they were given an immediate opportunity to modify their output after receiving relevant input (i.e., a model text) within an output-input sequence. The study employed a pretest-posttest design, with a written story-retelling task as the treatment. A retrospective debriefing questionnaire was used to probe learners’ noticing. L2 development was measured through a recognition test, a paraphrase test, and a text completion task. Results indicated that learners who had output opportunities during the treatment significantly outperformed those who did not, as measured by the production posttests, although no significant difference was found on the recognition posttest. Additionally, the immediate opportunity to modify output following output-input activities did not significantly affect learners’ subsequent recognition or production of the targeted form. The findings are discussed in relation to the research design and existing literature, with pedagogical implications provided.",1342
2024,Navigating Investment and Collaboration: A Study of Uzbek Undergraduates in a South Korean Writing Course,"Objectives This ethnographic multiple-case study investigated three Uzbekistani international students’ barriers to classroom access at a South Korean university and their collaborative interactions with local South Korean peers. To analyze the impact of capital and ideologies in the host community on international students’ investment in collaborative activities, Darvin and Norton’s (2015) model of investment was employed. The dynamics of collaboration were assessed with Storch's (2013) model of dyadic interaction.
Methods This qualitative study was conducted from September 2022 to June 2023. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with the focal participants, their peers, and their teacher, supplemented by classroom observations and analysis of educational materials over two semesters. Miles et al. (2014)'s analytical strategy was used to code the data, including interview transcripts and field notes.
Results The findings of the study highlighted that the barriers stemmed from the inability of students to balance the need to obtain necessary economic capital with classroom investment. Moreover, differences between local and international students’ habitus affected the dynamics of their learning investment and collaboration.
Conclusions Based on these insights, the researchers advocated for culturally sensitive pedagogical strategies, including cross-cultural discussions and the use of diverse ideological perspectives on online platforms, to foster equal learning contexts.",1513
2024,A Study on the Sequential Landscape Characteristics of Access Routes to Major Attractions -Focused on Miryang-si-,"This study aims to secure foundational data for landscape improvement projects at key visitor sites in Miryang, an inland small city, by examining the circulation systems and landscape characteristics of major sites. The study focused on 15 major places in Miryang that had a high number of external visitors from 2019 to 2021. It was found that these places are primarily accessed via three national highway routes, three local roads, and ten sections of other roads in eup or myeon. For national highway routes, it was noted that many sections near the city boundaries have rows of trees and predominantly feature mid-to-long distance open visual structures with agricultural landscape elements. Therefore, a landscape maintenance method considering an external landscape experience was deemed more efficient for these routes. On the other hand, local road routes were found to have a somewhat enclosed visual structure, with landscape elements such as mountain greenery, farmland, roadside trees, streams, and lakes appearing at relatively close distances from the experience location, making an internal landscape experience-based maintenance method more effective. However, it was also noted that there needs to be a preliminary review of road structural improvements or parking service space provisions due to increased traffic from internal landscape experiences. Other roads in eup or myeon are characterized by short sections or difficulties in vehicle access, making landscape maintenance and improvement methods that consider pedestrian or walking-based sequence experiences more efficient. Moving forward, it is hoped that this study can serve as a fine example of landscape improvement research for small and medium-sized cities through continued research that reflects various conditions and on-site situations.",1825
2024,A Study on the Effect of Appearance Interest and Perception of Beauty Health Care on Beauty Care Behavior,"This study conducted an empirical analysis for the purpose of finding out the effect of adult women on beauty care behavior according to their appearance interest and beauty health care perception. The survey period is from December 1 to December 11, 2023, and a total of 300 copies were finally analyzed through an online survey. As a result of the analysis, the degree of interest in appearance was divided into two factors : interest in beauty health care and interest in cosmetics, and the perception of beauty health care was derived into a total of two factors : lifestyle factors and harmful factors. As for beauty health care behavior, a total of four factors were derived: cosmetic selection, management expertise, nutrition, and exercise. As for the effect of appearance interest on beauty health care behavior, the higher the interest in beauty care, the higher the interest in beauty care, the higher the cosmetic selection behavior factor, and there was a significant influence relationship with management expertise, nutrition, and exercise, confirming that appearance interest is an influencing factor inducing active beauty care behavior. As a result of analyzing the effect of beauty health care perception on beauty care behavior, in the case of lifestyle perception, the effect was in the order of management expertise, exercise, nutrition, and cosmetic selection behavior, and the higher the awareness of harmful factors, the higher the cosmetic selection behavior and nutrition management. It is believed that this study can be used as practical data for future programs and educational research for beauty health care and maintenance in consideration of behavior related to beauty health care.",1715
2024,A Study on the Effect of Job Characteristics on Job Satisfaction and Organizational Commitment,"This study empirically analyzed the relationship between job characteristics perceived by organizational members and their influence on job satisfaction and organizational commitment as follows. First, hypothesis 1, job characteristics, was adopted as it showed a positive effect on organizational commitment. In other words, the empirical analysis showed that as job characteristics improve, organizational commitment improves. Second, the relationship between job characteristics and job satisfaction was analyzed to be statistically significant, and Hypothesis 2 was adopted. In other words, as job characteristics increase, job satisfaction increases. Third, Hypothesis 3, job satisfaction, was adopted as it showed a positive relationship with organizational commitment. In other words, as job satisfaction improved, organizational commitment improved. As shown in the results of this study, job characteristics served as a major factor affecting organizational commitment and job satisfaction. Accordingly, it is necessary to re-establish the system and continue its implementation to advance job characteristics to improve job satisfaction and organizational commitment.

2024,Managing Multiple Embeddedness and Expatriate Staffing Strategies: A Multilevel Investigation of Korean Multinationals,"How do multinational enterprises (MNEs) organize their expatriate staffing strategies in response to varying degree of multiple embeddedness? This study investigates how MNEs configure a crucial managerial resource, i.e., expatriates, across a subsidiary portfolio embedded in diverse locations with differing scale and scope. I conduct a multilevel analysis using a dataset of 130 Korean MNEs and their 2,119 overseas subsidiaries operating 77 countries. The results show that MNEs with high multinationality and a strong home-region orientation utilize lower levels of expatriate staffing in their subsidiary portfolio, suggesting that MNEs adjust expatriate utilization based on the degrees of national and regional dispersion. In contrast to conventional wisdom, this study finds that the level of expatriate deployment has a U-curve relationship with subsidiary age. Drawing on resource dependence and organizational learning perspectives, this study reveals that MNEs utilize higher levels of expatriate staffing in their younger and older subsidiaries while maintaining lower expatriation levels in their adolescent subsidiaries. This suggests that MNEs seek to achieve differentiated fit with their multiple subsidiaries by utilizing expatriates, who play a crucial role as a regulating mechanism for headquarters and a knowledge conduit for MNEs, acting as boundary spanners.",1384

2024,A Study on Local Festival Cultural and Creative Design : China’s H Island Mid-Autumn Festival Centered Celebration,"Festival cultural and creative design research can organically combine local festival cultural elements into visual products, become a carrier for circulation and communication, carry forward traditional culture, and enable teenagers to identify with traditional culture and generate a sense of pride and belonging. It is conducive to national unity and unity. Cultural and creative products in the market circulation can also bring great competitive value to the local. Based on the literature analysis, case study, and pastoral investigation, this paper analyzes the mascot brand image of H Island. By taking the Mid-Autumn Festival in H Island of China as an example, it discusses the cultural and creative design of domestic festivals, and conducts the cultural and creative design of domestic festivals for the audience of children and youth, the audience of Mid-Autumn Festival wedding, and the packaging of high-end mooncakes to spread the domestic festival culture. In terms of the Mid-Autumn Festival cultural and creative product strategy for the youth, it is to start from the concept of calling on the youth to “frequently go home for family reunion” and the cultural theme of the Mid-Autumn Festival. Apart from representing the family reunion, the full moon stands for perfect love. This theme is taken to develop cultural products. Improving the recognition of domestic festivals is the primary task to advocate for festival culture. A series of designs of domestic traditional cultural and creative products can not only enhance the image of the country’s culture, but also highlight the brand personality of the country’s culture, and effectively distinguish the personality and visual recognition of foreign cultures. Indeed, the competition of different cultures is the competition of their own cultural symbols. Thus, we should pay attention to dig deep cultural connotation to design cultural and creative products, realize the visual and effective distinction with foreign cultures, more directly enable the audiences to have emotional connection with the domestic culture, improve the cultural value, and ultimately heighten the national cultural competitiveness more effectively.",2203
2024,Natural Evaporation Rate of Toluene in Aqueous Solution for Correct Estimation of Adsorption Performance,"In this work, we examine the natural evaporation rate of toluene in aqueous solutions as a function of concentration,time, and temperature, with the aim of refining our understanding of its behavior and increasing the precisionof adsorption performance evaluations. To this end, the well-established Antoine equation is utilized to calculate the evaporationrate of toluene in the investigated systems. Our findings reveal a marked dependence of toluene evaporation onboth time and temperature, with a discernable increase in the mass of evaporated toluene observed as exposure durationsare extended and temperatures are elevated. This underscores the importance of scrupulous control over experimentalconditions in order to obtain reliable results. By incorporating the natural evaporation rate into the experimental design, onecan effectively minimize the influence of evaporation on the outcomes. This may contribute significantly to a comprehensiveunderstanding of toluene evaporation in aqueous environments, offering a valuable reference for future endeavors in tolueneremoval, be it through adsorption or alternative techniques. Moreover, our findings serve to inform the optimizationof experimental designs in future studies, drawing attention to the critical role that both time and temperature play in theevaporation of toluene, thereby facilitating more accurate and reproducible results in this field of inquiry.",1423
2024,A Study on the Effectiveness of Advanced Life Support Education and Reeducation Program Based on High-Fidelity Simulation,"This study was attempted to confirm the effectiveness and continuity of education by providing a simulation-based advanced life support education program to fourth-year nursing students and measuring the knowledge of professional CPR immediately after and after 5 months of training. After 5 months of conducting high-fidelity simulation-based professional CPR training, the results of knowledge measurement after retraining using video and training for team approach simulation were 19.23±1.923 in the experimental group and 16.03±2.752 in the control group(p.=<001). The effect of continuing education in the experimental group decreased from 22.30±1.473 to 19.23±1.923. Through the research results, the effect of professional CPR education consisting of theoretical lectures, skill practice, and team-based simulation practice was confirmed. However, the effect of continuing education after 5 months decreased, confirming the necessity of regular retraining. In other words, professional CPR education based on high-fidelity simulation is a very effective teaching method, but it is difficult to expect continued effects with one-time education, so periodic retraining is required.",1186

2024,Review of Recent Additive Manufacturing and Welding Research with Application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks,"This review introduces recent research on applying physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to additive manufacturing and welding. PINNs, which are artificial intelligence models, integrate governing equations containing physical information with artificial neural networks, enabling the modeling of complex physical phenomena at a lower computational cost than traditional numerical models. Although PINNs have been employed in a limited number of studies on welding processes, they have been extensively used in various studies within the field of additive manufacturing. This study reviews the theoretical background of PINNs to explore their effective application to welding processes, examining 12 research cases in additive manufacturing and two research cases in welding processes. The analysis included the structure of the PINN, governing equations, and prediction results of each study. Results indicate that PINNs provide faster computation speeds and higher prediction accuracies than numerical models. Moreover, they could perform analyses without additional training even when process parameters and materials changed. Additionally, PINNs have been effectively applied to predict the mechanical properties of the molten zone. Consequently, PINNs are anticipated to be actively applied in future research on welding process modeling and mechanical property prediction.",1381
2024,Analysis of European Partnership or National Interests on Voting Shapes on Trade Policy in the European Parliament,"· Research topic: Factors Influencing Voting in the European Parliament on Trade Policy: A Study Differentiating by MEPs' Party Affiliation, National Party, and Constituents' Situation· Background to research: The institutional development of the European Union has seen a gradual expansion of the powers of the European Parliament. Since the Lisbon Treaty came into force in December 2009, the European Parliament has gained co-decision-making authority alongside the Council of the European Union across a wide range of areas.· Differences from previous studies: Particularly in the field of trade policy, significant empowerment has occurred, including consent rights over trade negotiations. This implies an increasing influence of the European Parliament on EU trade policy in the future.
· Methodology: This study conducted empirical analysis using the proximity index and probit models to examine the factors influencing votes in the European Parliament on five trade-related resolutions, including the EU's free trade agreements with South Korea and Colombia-Peru, as well as safeguard legislation related to trade agreements.
· Research results: It was found that Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) generally vote according to the positions of their affiliated political parties within the European Parliament, rather than those of their national parties or constituents.

2024,A study on the variations of water temperature and sonar performance using the empirical orthogonal function scheme in the East Sea of Korea,"For measuring the performance of passive sonars, we usually consider the maximum Detection Range (DR) under the environment and system parameters in operation. In shallow water, where sound waves inevitably interacts with sea surface or bottom, detection generally maintains up to the maximum range. In deep water, however, sound waves may not interact with sea surface or/and bottom, and thus there may exist shadow zones where sound waves can hardly reach. In this situation, DR alone may not completely define the performance of each sonar. For complete description of sonar performance, we employ the concept ‘Robustness Of Detection (ROD)’. In the coastal region of the East Sea, the spatial variations of water masses have close relations with DR and ROD, where the two parameters show reverse spatial variations in general. The spatial and temporal analysis of the temperature by employing the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) shows that the 1-st mode represents typical pattern of seasonal variation and the 2-nd mode represents strength variations of mixed layers and currents. The two modes are estimated to explain about 92 % of the variations. Assuming two types of targets located at the depths of 5 m (shallow) and 100 m (deep), the passive sonar performance (DR) gives high negative correlations (about -0.9) with the first two modes. Most of temporal variations of temperature occur from the surface up to 200 m in the water column so that when we assume a target at 100 m, we can expect detection performance of little seasonal variations with passive sonars below 100 m.",1591
2024,A Study on the Legal Status of Collective Goods Transfer Security in China,"Transfer security, as an atypical form of security interest, has always been a focal point of academic attention. Despite the implementation of China's Civil Code and the Interpretations of the Guarantee System, there is still debate over whether transfer security should be considered an atypical security interest, and its value and status remain controversial. This paper aims to start from a hermeneutic perspective, deeply analyze the theoretical foundations of transfer security, and in conjunction with the progress of the Civil Code, the Interpretations of the Guarantee System, and relevant judicial interpretations, advocates that transfer security as an atypical security model should be recognized by the Civil Code.
Regarding the issue of transfer security for collectives, this paper deeply explores the legal nature of collectives and the rules of subrogation, and in conjunction with the relevant provisions of the Civil Code and the Interpretations of the Guarantee System, proposes that the publicity effect of transfer security for collectives should be enhanced and its subrogation should be confirmed. Such measures will provide effective protection for the realization of creditors' rights, especially beneficial in protecting the interests of creditors and enhancing the safety of transactions when the security is substituted.
Furthermore, the article also proposes solutions for the problem of excessive security for collectives. It is recommended that before establishing security, a reasonable evaluation of the collectives should be carried out, and proper negotiations should be conducted by both parties to prevent risks and contradictions. In cases of excessive security for collectives, the principle of ""one object, one right"" should be followed to confirm the separation of the collectives when changing the price, thereby clarifying the assumption of guarantee liability. This not only helps to balance the interests of all parties but also promotes the healthy development of financial transactions.",2035
2024,動物詞“同實異名”現象研究― 以“類解”類文獻爲中心,“同实异名”，从语言学的角度来看，是指一个事物对象而有不同的叫名的词汇现象，也称为“异名同实”。这不是简单的名称繁衍，是文化在语言中的折射，其中蕴含着人们的思维形式、价值观念、文化内涵及语言特质等深层意义。这是从古至今普遍存在的一种语言现象。本文基于“类解”类文献，以对应同一朝鲜语解释词为切入点，考察动物词“同实异名”的现象，不仅对朝鲜语词汇史的研究，而且对汉语词汇史研究会提供很好的语料。通过“类解”类文献中动物词汇的比较得出，人们常常通过动物的显著外部特征进行命名取象一般性的选择规律是以形体、纹色、习性为主的视觉感知优先；视觉中以动物的形体优先形体中又以量度和圆形优先。这些命名取象偏向于摄取浅表特征，体现着人们的认识是由浅入深、由表及里发展的。与此同时，指出了动物名词“同实异名”的成因包括符号关系型成因以及认知型成因两大类，揭示了“名”与“实”结合的规律性。,386

2024,A Study on the Creation of Popular Culture Brand Based on 'Big Marketing',"Research topics: This paper attempts to explore a practical path that integrates popular culture brands and 'big marketing' thinking. In this study, the concept of creating popular culture brands is analyzed by 'big marketing' thinking and integrated with global marketing trends for brand creation to propose ideas for creating popular culture brands including the level of appearance, the level of functionalization, the level of awareness, and the level of life. · Research background: ""Big Marketing"" emphasizes the entire process rather than a single marketing link, which is different from general ""marketing"". Marketing exists everywhere, from planning, promotion, and implementation of brand activities to long-term practice, and it is the most basic implication of ""Big Marketing"" thinking. This mode of thinking enhances understanding of brand creation. ""Big Marketing"" thinking, a new way of thinking in the process of creating a popular culture brand, is organically connected to each other in four aspects: overall collaboration, emotional connection, digital empowerment, and subject connection. · Differences from prior research: First, existing studies generally focus on traditional marketing strategies or specific marketing techniques, but this study introduced a new concept of 'big marketing' and applied it to the creation of popular culture brands. Second, while many preceding studies focused on specific industries or product categories, this study explored brand creation strategies targeting a wide category of popular culture. Third, existing studies often tend to focus only on specific elements of marketing, and this study comprehensively deals with various aspects of brand creation using big marketing as part of an integrated marketing communication strategy. Fourth, this study presented specific strategies and examples that can be applied in the actual marketing field as well as theoretical contributions. Fifth, instead of the traditional brand creation methodology, an innovative approach using data analysis and technology was proposed. · Research method: This study referred to various literatures from a theoretical perspective and suggested a practical path through popular culture brand and 'big marketing' thinking by referring to recent global marketing trends from a practical perspective. · Research results: Based on the concept of 'big marketing' as a result of this paper, a 'full chain' service system was developed to create popular culture brands. It suggested building resource pockets as a first step, drawing participant portraits as a second step, extracting activity topics as a third step, building various experiences as a fourth step, and connecting various platforms as a fifth step. · Contribution points and expected effects: First, big marketing based on data was applied to the creation of popular culture brands. Second, a plan to induce consumer interest through a brand strategy reflecting the characteristics of popular culture was suggested. Third, useful information was provided for establishing an integrated strategy that combines various marketing channels. Fourth, a platform was developed to help derive specific marketing strategies in consideration of practical aspects and global trends. Fifth, the idea of creating an innovative brand was proposed. Sixth, through the big marketing-based brand creation plan presented in this study, cost reduction and efficient resource utilization can be expected through efficient marketing activities. Seventh, the big marketing-based brand creation plan is expected to discover new market opportunities and promote creative marketing activities.",3667

2024,A Comparative Study on North Korean “Independence”: According to Changes in Sino-Russian Relations,"본 연구는 1960년대와 현재의 북한 자주노선을 비교 분석하고자 한다. 자주노선은 1960년대 북한이 중소분쟁의 틈바구니에서 소련과 중국에 대한 종속적 관계를 청산하고 독자적인 출발을 모색하는 과정에서 형성됐다. 중소관계가 갈등적이었기 때문에 그 틈바구니에서 펼치는 북한의 등거리외교가 자주노선이라는 애초의 목적을 달성할 수 있었지만, 사회주의 진영의 일원으로서 소련과 중국으로부터 제공받았던 혜택이 끊어짐에 따라 경제 발전과 군사 안보문제를 스스로 해결할 수밖에 없게 됐다. 결국 대외적 위협에 대응하기 위해 전개됐던 경제·국방 병진노선은 처참한 실패로 끝났다. 반면 중국과 러시아가 그 어느 때보다 밀착된 신냉전 구도로 접어들면서 북한이 중소분쟁 시기처럼 등거리외교의 실익을 취하기 어려워졌고, 북한-중국-러시아 간 삼각동맹이 강화됐다. 이와 함께 북한의 자주노선은 과거 중국과 러시아 등 우방국으로부터의 자주가 아닌 핵 무력 완성을 통한 정권안보, 나아가 국제사회로부터의 자주를 표방하며 1960년대 경제·국방 병진노선과 유사한 경제·핵무력 병진노선을 추구하고 있다. 강화된 삼각동맹 아래 추진되는 경제핵무력 병진노선은 대내적 위협인식에 따라 정권 안보를 위한 정치적 자주를 지향하고 있다는 면에서 과거 대외적 위협인식에 따라 국방에서의 자위를 추구했던 경제·국방 병진노선과 차이가 있다. 북한이 핵 무력 정책법까지 제정하며 정권 안보의 핵심적 수단인 핵 개발에 박차를 가하는 가운데 제재 강화로 인한 경제난은 가중되고 있다. 한미일 동맹에 맞서는 북중러 삼각동맹이 강화되는 가운데 경제핵무력병진노선을 수단으로 삼는 북한의 자주노선은 계속될 것으로 보인다.",818
2024,A Study on the Use of the Term ‘Fake News’ and Its Impact on Media Credibility,"This study aimed to expand the understanding of fake news by analyzing the relationship between the frequency of mentions of ‘fake news’ in the media and media credibility as the spread of fake news has emerged as a serious global issue. To achieve this, this study employed the Granger causality test to analyze the causal relationship between the annual number of reports mentioning ‘fake news’ and the credibility of newspapers, including the Chosun Ilbo, JoongAng Ilbo, and Dong-A Ilbo, and the three major broadcasting companies, KBS, MBC, and SBS, over the period of 1998-2022. Additionally, this study analyzed whether there was a significant relationship between the annual number of reports mentioning ‘fake news’ in newspapers and broadcasting companies. The results showed that there is a causal relationship where the number of reports mentioning ‘fake news’ in newspapers precedes the credibility of newspapers.
Similarly, the number of reports mentioning ‘fake news’ in broadcasting outlets was found to precede the credibility of broadcasting outlets. The findings indicate that the repeated use of the term ‘fake news,’ with its inherently negative connotations, can undermine public trust in journalistic institutions. This suggests the need for a proactive approach not only to fake news but also to the term ‘fake news’ itself.",1346
2024,20世纪二三十年代蒋光慈文学在韩国的接受与解读,蒋光慈是早期中国左翼文学的代表人物。在中国现代文学发生、发展当时，蒋光慈的小说、诗歌及有关革命文学的主张即在韩国得到了较为全面的介绍，像《鸭绿江上》《北京》《中国劳动歌》等体现革命意识和反对军阀或帝国主义压迫的作品，经由韩国知识分子的努力得到了传播。本文钩沉了20世纪二三十年代蒋光慈及其文学在韩国传播及解读的状况，从中发现，韩国知识分子主动译介了蒋光慈及其文学，表现出与中国文学同步性的一面；同时，在对其的解读中，他们也有着自己的考量，借此表达了自己的主体性和对革命的思考。像《鸭绿江上》因详细刻画了域外韩人的抗争而屡屡被韩国知识分子提起，《碎了的心》因透露出浓厚的反帝国主义精神而受到金台俊的关注，这无不说明韩国知识分子借蒋光慈的革命文学的书写表达了自己对革命的期待与想象。,339
2024,Research on K-Contents Production Technology Using Generative AI,"This study is about the use of generative AI in the production of K-content, a term referring to various media contents in Korea. In particular, it emphasizes the innovative influence of AI technology in all stages of video content production, including pre-production, production, and post-production. By leveraging AI-based tools for tasks such as script writing, trend analysis, casting, scene editing, and visual effects, producers can enhance creativity, increase efficiency, and improve production quality. Key findings show that generative AI can significantly streamline production processes by automating repetitive tasks, generating novel and creative ideas, and ensuring consistency of quality. For example, AI tools can assist with script writing and storyboard, while facial recognition algorithms and geographic data analysis can recommend actor casting and locations. During post-production, AI-based video editing and visual effects tools can be utilized to enhance the narrative cohesion and visual appeal of content, while generative audio tools can create custom sound effects. The significance of this paper is that it explores the potential of generative AI in K-content production and explores implications for the K-content industry to further grow and prosper in the global market in the future.",1319
2024,Study on the Influence of Chinese and American Monetary Policies on China’s Exchange Rate and Stock Market,"How to address the impact of U.S. monetary policy and regulate China’s exchange rates and stock market while maintaining domestic economic stability and mitigating financial risks is of significant practical importance. This article focuses on two types of monetary policy tools in China: quantity-based monetary policy tools and price-based monetary policy tools. For quantity-based tools, the proxy variable used is the money supply measure (M2).
For price-based tools, the proxy variable utilized is the national 7-day interbank borrowing rate (CHIBOR). By constructing a Markov-switching Bayesian vector autoregressive model (MSBVAR), this study investigated the impact of Chinese and American monetary policies on the exchange rate and stock prices in China. The research discovered that there is a Markov switching process in the relationship between Chinese and American monetary policies and the exchange rate as well as stock prices in China. The study’s findings indicate that the impact of US monetary policy and Chinese monetary policies on exchange rates and stock prices differs across different regime systems. For investors, utilizing monetary policy as critical reference information allows for reasonable anticipations regarding stock prices and exchange rate.",1278
2024,Policy Failure in Africa: Focusing on Ethiopian ICT Education Policy,"(Purpose) This study aims to explore determinants that fail Ethiopian Information and Communication Technology education policy. It investigates previous studies to categorize determinants in general and will focus on three determinants, which are identified in the grass-roots level to understand contextual characteristics that result in Ethiopian policy failure.
(Design/methodology/approach) This study employed qualitative research method to understand the impact of determinant on policy failure in Ethiopian Information and Communication Technology education policy. Data were collected via semi-structured interview, classroom observation and document analysis to examine the challenges faced in implementing ICT-integrated teaching and the impact of the learning environment and ICT materials on ICT utilization in teacher training institute and secondary schools.
(Findings) The findings of the study indicates that three major determinants (political, bureaucratic, and economic) contribute to ICT education policy failures. Although these are associated with contextual characteristics of Ethiopia, it may also be relevant to ICT-related policy studies in other developing contexts.
(Research implications or Originality) This study contributes to identify the determinants of Ethiopian ICT education policy by categorizing three different aspects. In addition, it is also expected to be used by Korean government to enhance the competitiveness of ICT-related Official Development Assistance program to developing countries, including Ethiopia.",1556
2024,Exploring the Gender Gap in Reading Literacy: A Case Study of Cambodia’s PISA for Development,"The objective of this study is to explore the gender disparities highlighted in the PISA for Development results, particularly focusing on the reading literacy challenges faced by Cambodian boys. This study seeks to understand the contextual factors and unique challenges underpinning this trend, set against Cambodia's evolving educational landscape.
While prior research has largely centered on gender disparities in education with an inclination towards the challenges faced by girls, especially in male-dominant society as Cambodia, this study reviews the growing issues of boys' academic underperformance.
Using the PISA-D dataset, the study conducts a quantitative analysis of the academic outcomes of 15-year-old students enrolled in Cambodian schools. Employing a two-step approach, the study first undertakes a series of t-test to determine the significant differences in the educational context of boys and girls, and then conducts mediation analysis to evaluate the impact of the different context on reading performance.
According to the PISA-D sample of the 15-year-olds who were already enrolled in schools, Cambodian girls significantly receive more concentrated engagements from their parents than boys, contrary to prevailing perceptions. Also, while household chores have traditionally been a focal point for girls, Cambodian boys also are faced with familial obligations related to out-of-home labors. Attitude to schooling did not show significant difference for boys and girls. These accumulated differences contribute, in part, to the comparatively lower reading literacy performance.
The findings underscore the intricate dynamics of gender within Cambodian education. They hint at an urgent need for educational reforms that encompass the distinct challenges faced by both genders. Moreover, with the evolution of socio-cultural norms and the recognition of boys' academic struggles, strategies to address these newfound challenges must be identified to ensure an equitable academic landscape.",2017

2024,English Pre-service Teachers' Perceptions of Using ChatGPT in Course Assignments,"Since the introduction of generative AI, teacher education programs have been interested in utilizing ChatGPT in the curriculum. As such, this study explored English pre-service teachers' perceptions of using ChatGPT in course assignments. The online survey was conducted with 75 English pre-service teachers (PSTs) in a college. The study results showed that over half of PSTs recognized ChatGPT as a useful tool for saving writing time and working on their assignments efficiently. In addition, ChatGPT was primarily used for idea generation and information gathering in the pre-writing phase and for editing and grammar checking in post-writing phase. However, English PSTs raised concerns regarding the information quality, sources, and reliability. Their prior experience of using ChatGPT influenced their future utilization. Therefore, it is recommended that course assignments be designed to use ChatGPT and that clear guidelines be provided in teacher education programs.",979
2024,장수將帥의 역할과 덕목 ―《손자병법》을 중심으로,"The purpose of this article is to understand the role and virtue of the commander in ""The Art of War"". Sun Tzu(孫子) saw the war as a serious matter of life and death of the people and the survival of the nation. Sun Tzu maintained a very cautious stance on the war based on the principle of stabilizing the country and preserving the army. Sun Tzu thought that making the enemy surrender by allies’ tactic without fighting was the best way and a complete victory in the war. To do this, it is necessary to lay the foundations for winning in everyday life and to create conditions to win during wartime. It is the commander who plays this role. The commander must have the virtues of wise, trust, affection, courage, and dignity. The commander must know all the knowledge about the military affairs as well as the operation in depth, to be trusted by the soldiers, to love the soldiers, and to have the courage and dignity to judge them objectively. These virtues must be exercised in a natural and timely manner so that the subordinates will sincerely obey and fight with desperate determination.",1095

2024,The Effect of Corporate Prosecutions on Corporate Financial Policy in U.S. Firms,"I investigate the impact of corporate prosecutions on firm risk and corporate financial policy. Using a unique dataset from Corporate Prosecution Registry compiled by Duke University School of Law and Legal Data Lab at the University Virginia, I find that the prosecuted U.S. firms exhibit negative buy-and-hold stock returns and high turnover ratios in the stock market, using univariate tests. Moreover, I implement a difference-in-differences model, and find that the risk associated with the prosecuted firms in the stock market significantly increases after the prosecutions. Consequently, those firms are likely to hold more cash following the prosecutions, and even decrease their capital investments and mergers and acquisitions when they are imposed heavy regulatory fines.",782
2024,Career and Life Development of a Gifted Student in Poverty: A Qualitative Longitudinal Case Study,"This research is a qualitative study of Semi (alias), a gifted Korean male high school student living in urban poverty. Interviews with Semi 6 times for three years, 60 minutes per interview, were analyzed as a part of a longitudinal qualitative study. Semi had been overwhelmed by the harsh environment and unable to move forward. Semi was the only gifted among participants with the highest IQ (in the gifted range with Korea Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Ⅳ at age 17). Although he had the highest intellectual ability among the participants, he did not have confidence in himself. And he did not achieve anything at all when he graduated high school. He spent another year to prepare the college entrance exam, but he failed and left the research for good. The qualitative data were analyed into six themes (neglected childhood, intimate, but worried father, housing instability, helpful teacher, frustrated dream of astronomer, lack of motivation to escape poverty). Among them a representative example of Semi's poor environment is housing instability and Semi's disadvantage is also revealed in that he did not meet an adult who could be a role model for life. The implications and suggestions for future research in career education and counseling were discussed.",1274
2024,A Survey on Efficient Resource Allocation Methods in Integrated Sensing and Communication,"With the explosive increase in the number of devices intervening in wireless networks in recent years, the shortage of radio spectrum resources has become a critical concern. Radar sensing and wireless communication, as two essential radio applications, are both technologies that utilize the transmission and reception of radio waves. Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) enables the two machines sharing infrastructure and spectrum so that the interaction between the two functions can realize better quality of service while efficiently conserving spectrum resources. Since the technical details and the utilization of radar and communication are different, the implementation of ISAC concerns the sharing of spectrum resources but and the deep integration of hardware, software, and signal-processing technologies. The detailed signal layer integration depends on the several key technologies, including waveform design, signal processing, and resource allocation. How to effectively utilize limited resources to achieve ideal sensing and communication quality of service is a significant issue. In this paper, we will focus on the relevant research and development of resource allocation optimization for ISAC.",1223

2024,"German Ordoliberalism in Policy Decision Making: A Comparison of Germany, the U.S. and Korea","Economic freedom was to be protected and guaranteed by a constitutional political order according to ordoliberal thinkers like Walter Eucken, Franz Böhm and Hans Grossmann-Doerth. The fundamental goal of ordoliberalism was and still is to limit discretionary policy-making by enshrining in the constitution open and rigorous regulations designed to restrain what these scholars view as democratic excess and its effects on decision-making. According to ordoliberalism, since legal rules and economic activity are mutually dependent, economic order is equivalent to legal order. For this reason it is crucial to understand who makes laws and how. Therefore Ordoliberal principles emphasize the role of government and legislation in creating order and creativity as well as how important these functions are to the market and society.
Although the modern state is not a sufficiently order-establishing power, Walter Eucken argued in his 1952 book Grundsätze der Wirtschaftspolitik that it might become one—but only with the help of science (Eucken 1952). Experts in law and economics are to advise decision-making processes. Their remit is broad: in addition to providing theoretical abstract knowledge they must address real-world economic issues and advise the government accordingly. This study delves into the U.S., Germany and Korea regarding the composition and duties of their respective economic decision-making councils, the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), the Sachverständigenrat zur Begutachtung der gesamtwirtschafilichen Entwicklung (SVR) and the National Economic Advisory Council (NEAC), respectively. The results of this study indicate that the CEA exhibits low-independency, low-stability, and high-value-judgment. Conversely, high-independency, high-stability, and low-value-judgment are revealed by the SVR. Furthermore the NEAC exhibits low-independency, low-stability, and high-value-judgment. We conclude that the features of the rule-based and scientific SVR in Germany are largely shaped by German ordoliberalism.",2039

2024,A study on the combination of fantasy and realism revealed in 〈Jibaro〉- focusing on the re-mediation theory of Bolter and Grusin,"〈Jibaro〉, one of the episodes of season 3 of Netflix's anthology animated series 〈Love, Death + Robot〉 and directed by Alberto Mielgo, made headlines at the time of its release for its great immersion and realism. However, it is difficult to say that 〈Jibaro〉 is a work aimed at realizing a photo-realistic image. This is because the director's unique art style is revealed throughout the artwork through the free expressive power of the animation medium. This study was conducted under the judgment that 〈Jibaro〉 is a work that achieves a unique achievement that shows surprising realism while also containing surreal and fantastic images at the same time, and that it is necessary to analyze the components constituting it. In addition, since criticism or research on 〈Jibaro〉 has rarely been conducted in Korea, this paper is expected to be more valuable. In this study, the components and directing methods of 〈Jibaro〉 were analyzed, focusing on the re-mediation theory of Bolter and Grusin. First, after closely examining the re-mediation theory of Bolter and Grusin, the form and direction of re-mediation described in the re-mediation theory were described. After that, the components of 〈Jibaro〉 were analyzed based on the re-mediation theory, and the way 〈Jibaro〉 combined realism and fantasy were analyzed. It is hoped that this study will be of great help to new media creators to effectively realize vivid and true experiences.",1439

2024,"Long-term Study on the Relationship Between Ethical Commitment, Corporate Financial Performance, and Valuation of Korean Companies","In recent decades, various stakeholders such as shareholders, managers, owners, customers, employees, policymakers, and environmentally-conscious NGOs have increasingly sought to understand the correlation between organizational business ethics and financial performance as well as stock market valuation. Despite the significance of this relationship, limited studies have explored the long-term connection between corporate ethical commitment, corporate valuation, and financial performance. To address this gap, our study examines the relationship between the Ethical Commitment Index of Korean companies and their financial performance and valuation in the Korean stock market from 2001 to 2021.
BE data used in this study comes from two questionnaire surveys carried out in 2005 and 2015 on a sample of Korean companies. Since the data was collected using the same survey instrument, it is comparable for both research periods, which is necessary for a long-term analysis. We engaged a major research firm to conduct the surveys to minimize potential collection bias. For consistency, we used the same research firm in 2005 and 2015 and maintained a consistent data format across both periods. Given that our research question examines the relationship between business ethics and corporate valuation, we selected publicly traded companies with extended trading histories in the stock market.
Our findings reveal a significant positive relationship between corporate ethical commitment and valuation on the KRX. Our findings bring meaningful insights to managers as well as various groups of stakeholders. In addition, the empirical analysis findings of this study confirm the logic of good management theory, and the more ethical activities & commitment a company engages in, the more outsider investors take this as a positive signal into stock market. Since the results of this study are consistent with the findings of the 2005 research, it was confirmed that the degree of ethical commitment of companies is meaningfully working as positive information to the stock market. This study provides meaningful insights and limitations for the empirical analysis results.",2175
2024,Anatomy and Histology of the Olfactory Organ of Asian Swamp Eel Monopterus albus,"The anatomy and histology of the olfactory organ of Monopterus albus was investigated using stereo microscopy, light microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The external structure of the olfactory organ exhibited closed anterior and posterior nostrils parallel to the skin surface.
The interior structure consisted of a pipe-like chamber, and lower and upper accessory nasal sacs. The olfactory chamber was composed of the sensory and non-sensory epithelium, and an unidentified organ. The sensory epithelium of the pseudostratified epithelial layer was composed of olfactory receptor neurons, supporting cells, basal cells, and lymphatic cells; and the non-sensory epithelium of the stratified squamous layer contained stratified epithelial cells and mucous cells with acidic mucopolysaccharides. The presence of intraepithelial blood capillaries and abundant dermal vascularization in the sensory epithelium of the olfactory chamber may provide strong histological evidence that respiration occurs through the olfactory epithelium.",1039
2024,A Methodology for Teaching Corpus-Based English Vocabulary to Korean College Learners,"Objectives The purpose of this study is to explain and introduce a methodology of teaching and learning corpus-based English vocabulary to Korean college students.
Methods A total of fifty-five students were divided into two groups. The control group included twenty-eight subjects and they took vocabulary lessons in the traditional method. The experimental group had twenty-seven learners and they did corpus-based vocabulary exercises. They were all female students. During one semester, the two groups studied all the same content and amount of target vocabulary, but they practiced two different types of vocabulary exercises at the beginning of the lessons. Four instruments were used to collect data from the learners: vocabulary tests, grammar tests, questionnaires and self-reports.
Results The result in this study showed that the two groups achieved significantly better scores in post vocabulary and grammar tests. Furthermore, the experimental group did better than the control group in grammar. Through questionnaires and self-reports, the students shared various feelings and opinions of the two classes after lessons. They expressed positive opinions and feelings about learning English and favoured the idea of studying vocabulary with self-reports. Some students felt the class was too easy.
Conclusions This research suggests an effective method for teaching corpus-based vocabulary. It also states the limitations of the study and has implications in TESOL for Korean College learners as they study the lexis.",1529

2024,Exploring Cross-Cultural Experience in Didactic Early Childhood Music Education: A Case Study in Indonesia-Germany,"Music education for young children in Indonesia often lacks a thorough, student-centered approach.
In contrast, Germany has long used didactic methods to teach music effectively to children. This article presents a qualitative case study comparing early childhood music education in Indonesia and Germany. Data were collected through direct observations in three educational institutions and semi-structured interviews with two German experts in early childhood music education. The findings revealed that there are different cross-cultural experiences of music learning in Indonesia and Germany in terms of cultural context, music education system, technical approach, community performance and collaboration. Seen from its characteristics, music education didactical learning approach is suitable and promising to be implemented in Indonesia. Furthermore, it is evident there is a need to balance teacher-centered and students-centered learning, in order to better address students' individual needs while maintaining the crucial role of teachers. Exploring early childhood music education methods in Germany can inspire educators and policymakers in Indonesia to develop a more diverse and inclusive approach to early childhood music education. This approach should integrate children's needs and interests and support the development of creativity and various abilities.",1374
2024,A Study on the Development of Future Corporate Value Forecasting Classifier Reflecting ESG Information,"Companies above a certain size that operate globally are showing increasing commitment to ESG (environmental, social, and governance) activities. The main goal of this study is to design a model that can predict future corporate value based on ESG score data. To this end, this study compares the predictions of the basic future corporate value prediction model on which previous studies have been based and those of the future corporate value prediction model proposed herein that includes ESG ratings. For a more rigorous analysis that obtains more comprehensive results, the current study presents results using five machine learning methods: CatBoost, Extra Trees, LGBM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boost. These results indicate that models that encompass ESG data consistently outperform models that do not encompass ESG data in terms of predicting future corporate value. This paper is characterized by its use of an interdisciplinary research methodology that uniquely introduces machine learning techniques, which are rarely used for empirical analysis in the financial and accounting fields.

2024,A Study on the Effectiveness of the Venture Capital Market Intervention Policy: The Case of the South Korean Government,"This study aims to empirically examine the role of government intervention in the venture capital environment in South Korea. The study conducted a literature review on government interventions in the venture capital ecosystem. For empirical analysis, annual data from the Korea Venture Capital Association and the Korea Fund of Funds from 2004 to 2021 were analyzed using time-series statistical methods and macroeconomic analysis. The literature indicates that government policy intervention in the venture capital ecosystem can be divided into direct, indirect, and temporal approaches. The direct approach includes both direct and indirect government investments. The case study shows that the Korean government primarily engages in indirect investment in private venture capital funds. The time-series analysis found that early-stage investments increased with a higher proportion of early-stage investment funds and preferred stock investments, whereas an increase in total venture fund formation led to a decrease in early-stage investments. Based on the findings from the case studies and empirical analysis, policy recommendations for indirect government intervention were proposed.",1191
2024,Mutual Fund Investments and Labor Investment Efficiency : Evidence from Korea,"[Purpose]This paper examines the effects of mutual fund investments on labor investment efficiency and explores the potential mechanisms that alter a firm’s investment decisions：a firm’s internal cash flows and their affiliation with mutual funds.
[Methodology]We use a sample of Korean firms that were publicly traded between 2008 and 2016 in estimating the effect of mutual fund investments on labor investment efficiency by OLS regression. Propensity score matching and Heckman two－stage regression techniques are used to alleviate endogeneity issue.
[Findings]We found that mutual fund investments increase the efficiency of labor investments by inhibiting underinvestment behavior. Furthermore, additional analyses showed that the positive influence of mutual fund monitoring is stronger for firms that lack internal funds and in cases in which the mutual funds and firms belong to the same business group.
[Implications]This study contributes to the corporate governance literature on the role of institutional investors and extends the prior literature on the determinants of labor investment efficiency.",1111
2024,Etiology and Outcomes of Patients with Extreme Hyperbilirubinemia in Korea: A Retrospective Cohort Study,"Background/Aim: Extreme hyperbilirubinemia is occasionally observed in intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU settings. This study examined the etiologies of extreme hyperbilirubinemia (bilirubin level ≥12 mg/dL) and the factors associated with the 30-day mortality.
Methods: This retrospective observational cohort study identified 439 patients with extreme hyperbilirubinemia at the Gyeongsang National University Changwon Hospital between 2016 and 2020. The patients were classified into three groups and 11 diseases according to their etiology. The risk factors associated with 30-day mortality at the baseline were investigated using the Cox proportional hazards model.
Results: Of 439 patients with extreme hyperbilirubinemia, 287, 78, and 74 were in the liver cirrhosis/malignancy group, the ischemic injury group, and the benign hepatobiliary-pancreatic etiological group, respectively, with corresponding 30-day mortality rates of 42.9%, 76.9%, and 17.6%. The most common disease leading to hyperbilirubinemia was a pancreatobiliary malignancy (28.7%), followed by liver cirrhosis (17.3%), hepatocellular carcinoma (10.9%), and liver metastases (8.4%). The etiologies of hyperbilirubinemia, obstructive jaundice, infection, albumin level, creatinine level, and prothrombin time-international normalized ratio were independently associated with the 30-day mortality.
Conclusions: This study suggests three etiologies of extreme hyperbilirubinemia in the ICU and non-ICU settings. The prognosis of patients with extreme hyperbilirubinemia depends largely on the etiology and the presence of obstructive jaundice.",1618

2024,A Comparative Study on Protecting Chinese Seafarers’ Labor Rights: Focusing on the Introduction of Korea’s Seafarers Act,"With China’s seafarer workforce continuously expanding but lacking dedicated legal protections for labor rights, enacting a separate Seafarers Law represents a critical approach to addressing this gap. Legal transplantation is an essential method in lawmaking, and comparative law serves as a foundational step in this process. By comparing the connotation and denotation of the term “seafarer” in Korea and China, it is evident that China should define “seafarers” to include domestic coastal and international navigation seafarers when drafting the Seafarers Law. A comparative analysis of seafarers’ labor rights legislation in Korea and China, from the macro level of the legal system and the micro level of core norms, highlights several problems in China’s current framework: low legal hierarchy, a legal system structure misaligned with the principle of proportionality, norms that are incomplete and vague, regulatory redundancy and contradictions, and an emphasis on administrative management over rights protection. These insights provide clear guidance for China in developing a separate Seafarers Law by 2035.",1121
2024,The Trap of Presumption: A Case Study of Agricultural Research for Early Detection of Brown Planthopper Damage in Rice Fields,"The lack of understanding of topics in uncharted research areas can often be mitigated through a careful review of the existing literature. However, when a field is not well-studied, relying on assumptions before starting a project should be avoided. This article highlights the dangers of such presumptions as demonstrated by the case of brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) detection in rice field. Although unpiloted aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown promise in various agricultural applications, their effectiveness in the early detection of brown planthopper damage was initially assumed based on the expectation of visible symptoms. The image analysis in the current study indicated that images obtained from a camera mounted on a UAV could not detect the symptoms of the very early stages of damage from brown planthoppers. An overlooked factor was whether the pest damage was uniformly distributed across an entire rice plant. If symptoms appear consistently, early detection using a top-down view from a UAV is possible; otherwise, detection may be delayed. Our findings emphasize the need for thorough preliminary research to avoid failure. By investigating the biological characteristics of the target pest and the potential limitations of detection methods, researchers can greatly improve their chances of success. We hope that readers will recognize the importance of thoroughly examining unexplored areas before embarking on new research.",1455
2024,A Study on the Establishment of a Master Plan for Training Indonesian Trade Manpower: Focusing on Korean Experience,"Indonesia‘s economy is expected to gradually develop by leveraging the world’s fourth-largest population. Through cooperation with such large markets, Korea can create mutually beneficial opportunities for trade expansion and economic development between the two countries. This study, based on Porter’s diamond model, identifies key factors necessary for cultivating trade manpower and analyzes the importance of each factor using AHP analysis targeting trade-related experts. The results indicate that ‘factor conditions’ are recognized as relatively important compared to other factors in supporting Indonesia’s trade manpower training, with the supply of trained trade manpower being particularly prominent. Additionally, the willingness of companies to export is considered an important factor in terms of demand conditions, and the demand for trade manpower also plays a significant role in nurturing manpower. It is emphasized that cooperation between associations and manpower training institutions is essential in terms of ‘related and supporting (R&S) industries,’ and that core economic actors should have the will to cultivate trade manpower in terms of ‘firm strategy, structure, and rivalry (SSR).’ This study aims to explore opportunities to further strengthen cooperation with Korea through the establishment of a master plan for training Indonesian trade personnel. It suggests that securing excellent professional trade personnel based on this cooperation is crucial not only for Indonesia but also for enhancing Korea’s competitiveness.",1555

2024,A Study on Brand Design Renewal Case : Focused on Russian Traditional Tea Brand,"Travniki Sibiri, located in Siberia, is hidden in the pure nature of Russia: vast green areas, centuries-old pine forests, majestic mountains, crystal-clear rivers and lakes. The land of Siberia has long been responsible for the livelihood of all Slavs, as it grows special and valuable medicinal plants and herbs. Many wild fruits found only in Siberia are dozens of times more valuable and useful than modern cultivated fruits and berries, and these are just a few of the gifts of Siberia’s nature. However, this iconic brand Travniki Sibiri in this unique region of Siberia is not able to convey a sense of premium quality from their design; logos in their own language, handmade packaging, and a lack of marketing strategy is keeping this valuable asset hidden. This study aims to revive the brand identity of Travniki Sibiri through a design renewal and restore its position as a leading tea brand and traditional herbal tea specialist for global expansion. For the research, a number of case studies in worldwide markets were conducted, and the value of the brand was further enhanced by the addition of eco-friendly design. In this context, the design renewal of a Russian traditional tea brand should focus on design reconstruction with more premium strategy to enter the in demand market so that it can be naturally enjoyed by people of different cultures while maintaining the identity elements that form the brand image. Therefore, this paper proposes the following methods to revive the Travniki Sibiri brand: 1) forming a target group through a new positioning, 2) deriving core values and design concepts accordingly, 3) designing a brand identity, and 4) designing eco-friendly packaging that reflects experience-driven content of this beautiful region in Siberia.",1779

2024,A Study on the Structural Dimension of User Fit in Motion-sensing Games,"Through in-depth interviews and grounded theory, this paper first identifies six structural dimensions of user fit in motion-sensing games, which are sensory fit, cognitive fit, emotional fit, behavioral fit, social fit and body movement fit. Among these, cognitive fit, emotional fit, behavioral fit and social fit are consistent with the dimensions identified by previous studies, but their connotations are different.
Sensory fit and body movement fit reflect the new human-computer interaction phenomenon in motion-sensing games. The further developed formal scale contains 22 items. Through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, it was proved that the scale has good reliability and validity. Exploring the structural dimensions of user fit in motion-sensing games contributes to a deeper understanding of the field, and it has important implications for improving motion-sensing game design and user experience.",925
2024,日本語と韓国語に対する英語からの影響の測定比較,"This study aims to compare the level of influence from English on Japanese and Korean. We adopted scales proposed by Thomason (2001) and Matras (2007), and identified plausible indicators of English influence; the number of Anglicisms in each part of speech (POS), the number of borrowed derivational affixes, the number of borrowed phonemes, and the number of borrowed basic vocabulary. In order to compare Japanese and Korean based on these indicators, comparable data were created using the GLAD Database and Swadesh List. The results revealed that Japanese demonstrated a stronger influence from English in terms of the number of borrowed words, whereas Korean exhibited a more conspicuous phonological influence from English. No significant differences were observed in the number of borrowed derivational affixes and basic vocabulary. Overall, we conclude that there is no discernible difference in the level of influence from English to Japanese and Korean. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that",1005
2024,Empirical Evidence of the Discretionary Behaviors of the Tax Administration: A Korean Perspective,"Does the tax administration exercise discretion in adjusting its tax collection efforts according to the revenue situation? If so, what are the policies? This paper attempts to identify the discretionary behavior of the tax administration in a Korean context. To do so, I estimate the correlation between some variables representing the discretionary behavior of the tax administration and the tax collection progress ratio. This analysis shows that there is strong evidence for the discretionary behavior of the tax administration. This means that the intensity of tax collection efforts has changed according to the conditions of tax collection. The size of the discretionary behavior of the tax administration is estimated at 2.9% of total tax revenue (average absolute value in 1975-2015). The increase in the discretionary behavior of the tax administration can cause several problems. The fact that a significant part of tax revenue is determined by administrative behavior rather than by the law should be criticized if we consider the “no taxation without law” principle. Moreover, the discretionary behavior of the tax administration can lead to a weakening of the automatic stabilizers by reducing the sensitivity of the pro-cyclical movement of tax revenue.",1268
2024,Body and Soul: Redefining Aging in T. S. Eliot’s “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” and W. B. Yeats’s “Sailing to Byzantium”,"This paper aims to compare T. S. Eliot’s “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” (1917) and W. B. Yeats’s “Sailing to Byzantium” (1927) by focusing on aging. Theological/philosophical perspectives connecting aging to wisdom prevailed in the Middle Ages and pre-modern periods. However, beginning from the nineteenth century and prevailing in the twentieth, the changed perspective of equating aging to the body replaced the previous view. This study focuses on this shifted sociocultural attitude mirrored in Eliot’s poem. In “Sailing to Byzantium,“ Yeats, in his early 60s, feeling physical aging, first leaves for the ideal Byzantium, where there is no cycle of birth, growth, and death. He leaves the decaying body and pursues the world of the soul and artistic completion symbolized by Byzantium, but eventually realizes that neither art nor the soul can exist by itself. The poet concludes that humans must return to this mortal body, the grieving real world, accept all the pain, and lead the body and the soul together in real life.",1037
2024,A Study on the Critical Factor Analysis of Trade Facilitation in Customs Trade,"The trade facilitation concept of PTAs has evolved from limited provisions on customs issues to include more comprehensive provisions on regulatory and border issues affecting the movement of goods across borders. In addition, although the convergence of these provisions in terms of the subject matter and language of PTAs is increasing due to the influence of the WTO TFA, it is also unavoidable that significant differences remain.
The use of technology is supporting the modernization of customs, other regulatory and border agencies and expanding the scope of trade facilitation provisions. In particular, many countries are exploring the use of new technologies such as blockchain to support international trade and border management activities. In modern free trade agreements, a number of developments are taking place simultaneously to modernize and simplify the administration of preferential rules of origin. As customs administrations in each country make better use of automation concepts and build risk management and post-clearance audit capabilities, customs administration business processes will become more sophisticated. The modernization of customs administration is also likely to have an impact on the customs union, especially customs and tax collection. It is analyzed that the process, reporting and documentation requirements will be further simplified.",1380

2024,Analysis of the Marketing Communication Strategy for the Mythical Image of the Nine-Tailed Fox in South Korea,"With the growth of South Korea’s cultural industry, the nine-tailed fox has become a prominent figure in TV dramas, novels, comics, and games, playing a key role in South Korea’s cultural exports. This modernization of traditional culture has revitalized ancient symbols, breathing new life into them. While previous studies have highlighted the deep cultural significance of the nine-tailed fox mythological image and its broad appeal, there has been little quantitative analysis of the factors driving its current popularity.
This Study aims to explore the development and reconstruction of the mythical image of the nine-tailed fox in the Korean cultural content industry, with a focus on analyzing its marketing communication strategies.
Accordingly, this study identified eight key factors that influence the marketing communication strategies of South Korea’s nine-tailed fox imagery and conducted a survey on importance and satisfaction with 40 people, 20 each from South Korea and China. Through Importance Performance Analysis (IPA), the analysis result shows that cultural connotation, emotional resonance, and modernization transformation are locating at ‘Quadrant 1 - Keep up the good work’, while cross-industry collaboration and marketing effectiveness are locating at ‘Quadrant 4 Concentrate here’.
By analyzing these five elements from multiple levels and perspectives, this study proposed enhancements to the mythological image marketing communication strategy, emphasizing innovation rooted in tradition, the coexistence of human and divine elements, and the integration of contem- porary values. Furthermore, this research not only explores the transformation of traditional mythology into modern intellectual property but also establishes a framework for articulating traditional cultural values within a contemporary context.",1846

2024,How Does Foreign Support Account for Severity of Civil Conflict? Focusing on Intervening States’ Characteristics,"This article investigates the effect of foreign support on severity of civil conflict with a special attention to characteristics of foreign state supporters. We identify these attributes from the interveners’ domestic politics and relations with warring parties. Foreign support enhances belligerents’ capacity to wage a war, which makes them prefer escalating violence to reaching compromise. Democratic, co-ethnic, and rival state sponsors are likely to incite or acquiesce in their proxy’s aggression, which escalates the war and yields a large number of fatalities. Statistical analyses corroborate our argument. Foreign support from democratic states makes civil conflict severe, which suggests that democratic intervention actually stymies peaceful resolution of conflicts. The analyses also detect the effects of ethnic and rival supports on the severity of civil conflict, indicating that the conflict intensity is contingent upon the historical and emotive relations between interveners and belligerents.",1014

2024,《民法典》视域下正常经营买受人规则研究,“正常经营买受人规则”作为抵押财产的“流出”关系中买受人特殊保护规 则，曾被作为辅助规则置于浮动抵押制度项下. 直至中国于2019年世界银 行营商环境调查中“获得信贷便利度指标”之得分结果，立法者改变固守态 度，转而将其作为独立条文并上升为动产抵押畴域的一般规则，可谓兼 备效率与公平的技术性法律. 然而由于立法对这一规则仅作框架性的概念 性陈述，自法文本身的高度凝练性和价值追求抽象性，若不经解释将引 致实务审判的司法肆意. 同时，其与“动产抵押登记对抗规则”“动产抵押物 转让规则”为一组规范安排，梳理规则间衔接适用的重要性自不待言. 在 此意义上，打通“正常经营买受人规则”背后的体系论和解释论是最为核心 的问题. 本文以《民法典（物权编）》为研究底本，从域外立法以及实务 审判维度洞悉该规则之寓意. 在“抵押人处分自由”公之于世的背景下，通 过体系解释、目的解释等方式分析该规则与“动产抵押登记对抗规则”“动 产抵押物转让规则”应呈现的“强弱井然”动态关系. 从法律规范与社会效应 两方面，联系利益平衡方法解构该规则涵涉的运行要素，进一步精确其 中带出的创新性衍文. 基于解放财富理念，搭配落实合理性保护，以防止 一方盆丰钵满，另一方身陷困顿之僵局. 为防止抵押权人利益过分轻易丧 失，需要排除买受人在交易中存在“恶意”的情况，即买受人应持有相当程 度的“善意”. 除此之外，因买受人于“正常经营活动”中取得完整所有权后， 抵押财产上的抵押权归于消灭，此时赋予抵押权人就价款主张物上代位 之权利. 为促进物上代位权在实践中得以更好地运用，可在事后通过设定 权利质权之手段予以救济，同时配合设置额外补偿责任作以平衡利益的 维权砝码.,719
2024,Understanding Learner Agency: A Qualitative Study in a Chinese University English Classroom,"Objectives This study aims to explore the underlying personal and contextual factors influencing Chinese English majors’ ability to build and sustain agency in improving their oral English skills during a 16-week speaking course. By adopting an ecological perspective, the research seeks to identify how these factors serve as either resources or constraints to learner agency.
Methods The Qualitative case study was conducted during one full semester from March to June 2023. The researchers observed an English speaking course instructed by a Chinese female teacher. Data were collected through classroom observations, semi-structured interviews, and some related documents. Thematic analysis was used to identify the factors affecting the learners' agency in improving their oral English.
Results The findings revealed that (a) the students’ agency in improving their speaking skills was related to their past personal experiences; (b) strong self-efficacy belief is an important factor fostering learner agency in advancing their oral English, but the dominant exam-oriented educational tradition might hamper the oral English learning due to the time needed to prepare for exams; (c) the teachers’ feedback and mutual trust would stimulated students’ agency in enhancing their oral English; (d) learning resources and supportive school policy can contributed to the students' achievement of agency in developing their oral English; and (e) Aspirations involving academic and career goals may influence students' achievement of agency in boosting spoken English proficiency.
Conclusions This study demonstrated the complexity of factors affecting learner agency, thereby contributing empirical evidence to the chordal triad of agency from the ecological perspective. Moreover, recommendations are offered on how teachers can develop a more agency-supportive English speaking class.",1885

2024,A Comparative Study on the Post Derailment Behavior of Trains According to the Type of Derailment Containment Provisions,"Since the opening of the high-speed rail, the greatest attention of railway engineers has been on the problem of train derailment. It is difficult to completely prevent derailment accidents because there are always unpredictable derailment triggers. Therefore, the study of ways to restrain the derailed train within the intended area based on the understanding of the behavioral characteristics of the train after derailment has become particularly meaningful. The purpose of this paper is to experimentally analyze the function of derailment containment for each type of derailment containment provisions (DCPs). The derailment vehicle for full-scale testing is a connected wagon that connects one container wagon and one flat wagon. The types of DCPs considered to evaluate the differences in post derailment behavior are DCP Type I and Type III. To evaluate the functionality of DCP, post derailment behavior and vehicle motion were compared and analyzed for each type of DCPs.",981
2024,A Study on Differences in Intimacy and Loyalty by Gender Among Taiwanese Esports Fans,"E-sports around the world are rapidly growing as one of the global entertainment industries. As Taiwan's esports market develops significantly, fans' influence on the market is attracting attention. This study analyzed the differences in intimacy and loyalty toward e-sports fans and teams among male and female e-sports fans active in Taiwan's online community PTT(Bulletin Board System). The results of the survey showed that Taiwanese female esports fans were more active in consuming products and paying for them. On the other hand, male fans showed high participation in game play time, but female fans were more active in participating in communities and events. The reason for this difference appears to be that female fans tend to view esports players not simply as athletes, but as stars or entertainers like idols.",824
2024,A study on the wrinkle improvement effect of tea plant root’s saponin,"A major purpose of this study was to examine cytotoxicity, reactive oxygen species(ROS), collagenase, ,elastase, collagen biosynthesis, and matrix metalloproteinase(MMP)-1 to develop wrinkle-improving substances using TPRS(tea plant root's saponin). The cell survival rate was over 90%, confirming that it did not significantly affect the survival rate of fibroblasts. When treated at a concentration of 400 μg/mL TPRS, ROS production of 24.8% was reduced. Maximum inhibitory effect of collagenase of 36.1% was obtained in 400 μg/mL of TPRS. Maximum inhibitory activity of 36.1% of elastase was obtained in 400 μg/mL of TPRS. When the TPRS concentration was 400 μg/mL, the amount of collagen biosynthesis increased by about 45.1% compared to the control group. As the TPRS concentration increased, the activity of MMP-1 produced decreased, and in particular, when the concentration was 400 μg/mL, the activity of MMP-1 produced by 29.8% decreased compared to the control group. As a result of the above, it is considered that saponin, which is separated from the roots of tea plant(Camellia sinensis L.) can be used as an inner beauty material.",1144
2024,Degradation of Reactive Black 5 by potassium ferrate(VI),"This paper aims to study the degradation process for refractory azo dye namely Reactive Black 5(RB5) by potassium ferrate(VI) synthesized using the wet oxidation method. The process of degradation of azo dyes by Ferrate was studied with several parameters such as pH, different Ferrate(VI) dosage, different azo dye initial concentration, and temperature.
A second-order reaction was observed in all degradation processes for RB5 having the highest degradation efficiency.
The highest k app value of RB5 degradation was 190.49 M -1 s -1 . In the pH experiments, the neutral condition has been identified as the optimum condition for the degradation of RB5 with 63.2% of dye removal. The efficiency of degradation also depends on the amount of ferrate(VI) available in the reactor. Degradation efficiency increased with an increase in Potassium Ferrate(VI) dosage or a decrease of RB5 initial concentration. The temperature has been reported as one of the most important parameters. From the results, increasing the temperature(up to 45 o C) will increase the degradation efficiency of azo dye by Ferrate(VI) and if the temperature exceeds 45 o C, the degradation efficiency will be decreased.",1192
2024,A Study on Ship Path Following System Utilizing a Small Model Boat,"This study introduces a ship path following system achieved through the design of a course controller based on the ship's maneuvering model. Both simulations and experiments were conducted to validate the system's effectiveness. The ship's maneuvering model was identified by applying an ARX (Auto-Regression with eXtra input) model, representing the system model based on input-output data. The course controller employed PD (Proportional-Derivative) controller, recognized for its simplicity and excellent control performance. Prior to sea experiments, the effectiveness of the ship's maneuvering model and course controller was verified through simulation. Subsequently, sea experiments were conducted using a small model boat. The path following results in real sea conditions revealed a maximum cross track distance (XTD) of approximately 3.4m (3.7L) for the experimental boat, indicating successful path following along the predefined route.",947
2024,Impact of Firm-specific Textual Sentiment on Credit spreads,"While the impact of investor sentiment on the stock market has been extensively studied, there remains a notable gap in understanding similar dynamics in the bond market. To address this gap, this study examines the relationship between credit spreads and textual sentiment. Using natural language processing, we extract firm-specific sentiment expressed in news articles and blog posts and examine it them based on textual tone and emotion. Our findings are as follows. First, we find that sentiment is positively related to the subsequent decline in credit spreads. Sentiment derived from the news is more predictive of credit spreads than the sentiment derived from the blogs. Notably, the relationship between sentiment and credit spreads varies across market types. There is a negative correlation between sentiment and the following month's credit spread for KOSPI-listed firms, while a positive correlation is observed for KOSDAQ-listed firms. During crisis periods, such as the US-China trade war and COVID-19, the impact of sentiment on credit spreads increases. A long-short portfolio strategy based on sentiment generates significant profits, confirming the economic importance and the potential for investors to use sentiment analysis to generate returns.",1267
2024,Degradation Pattern Classification for Predicting Remaining Useful Life of Rolling-element Bearings,"In continuous-process systems, failures of rolling-element bearings typically cause accidents, reduced productivity, andproduction-related financial losses. Therefore, predicting both the lifespan of rolling-element bearings and their replacementtime is crucial for preventing machine system failures. Accordingly, numerous studies have reported various machine and deeplearning classifiers for predicting the lifespan of bearings. However, these studies did not consider degradation trends ofbearings. Thus, this study aimed to develop an algorithm to predict the lifespan of a bearing by considering its degradationtrend. A vibration dataset of bearings was obtained at low and high speeds. Using a second-order curve-fitting model, variousdegradation patterns in the dataset were classified. Appropriate time-domain or frequency-domain feature variables applicableto the design of a classifier were determined according to classified patterns. In addition, the classifier was trained usingmultiple bidirectional long short-term memories. Finally, the performance of the developed classifier was verified experimentally.",1122

The study assesses 60 variables based on the data from UN Regional Commissions (2015-2023), related to paperless trade in customs. Major findings show significant gaps in Uzbekistan's trade facilitation adoption rate with the lack of a National Trade Facilitation Committee, underdeveloped electronic single window systems, and lack of risk management. Uzbekistan shows lower indicators than the comparison countries in certain areas. Our paper includes theoretical and practical contributions, providing a roadmap for Uzbekistan to advance its paperless trade framework and align with global standards.",788
2024,Study on the Impact of RCEP Tariff Reduction on Shandong Province's Export to ROK,"This paper aims to analyze the impact path of tax reduction in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP) on Shandong's export to South Korea. The signing and entry into force of RCEP provides new trade opportunities for Shandong Province, but also brings challenges.
By analyzing the current situation of Shandong Province's export to South Korea, this paper discusses the direct and indirect impact of RCEP tax reduction on Shandong Province's export, and puts forward the corresponding development path.
The study found that RCEP's tax reduction measures significantly promoted Shandong's export to South Korea, especially in the fields of chemical products, clothing, and plastic products. However, Shandong also faces challenges from the relocation of low-end industries and a lack of understanding of the rules of the agreement. Therefore, Shandong Province needs to promote institutional innovation and strengthen industrial cooperation with Japan and South Korea to make full use of the policy dividends brought by RCEP and achieve sustainable economic development.",1095
2024,Colloquialization of American English: A case of restrictive relative clauses in the novel ‘Pachinko’,"This paper has investigated the colloquialization of American English in a best-seller novel Pachinko written in English by a well-recognized Korean-American writer Lee Min Jin. American English has been undergoing a language shift called ‘colloquialization’ for several decades. Written American English has deviated from using the formal, prescriptive, scholarly structures and preferred the use of informal, vernacular, oral speech-like structures, among which is restrictive relative clauses (RCs) (Leech & Smith, 2006, Hinrichs et al., 2015). While the animacy constraint is respected for animate and inanimate head nouns, the that-rule, preferring that over other relative heads such as which or ø, is reportedly observed in general and public writings such as novels. But that was the result from the data collected and reported over 30 years ago. According to the 948 restrictive RC data elicited from the novel Pachinko, it was obvious that the colloquialization of American English has furthered towards more economical RCs as doing away with overt relative heads. Surprisingly, while which was virtually non-existent in the novel, ø was predominantly preferred in all types of RCs (81.5% for object RCs, 70.6% for object RCs of preposition, and 59.2% for adjunct RCs) except for subject RCs where a Head must be overtly present. In that case, who was selected for animate Heads and that was selected for inanimate Heads. Overall, the that-rule was out of fashion, and the ø-rule was applied literally wherever and whenever possible. Contrary to Quirk et al. (1985), despite an intervening phrase between the Head and an RC and despite the complexity of the subject of RCs, ø was preferred. This paper concludes that the colloquialization of American English has rather simplified and systematized the choices of relative heads: maximally use ø if grammatical, maximally avoid which if possible, and respect the animacy constraint if ø can’t be enforced.",1964
2024,Research on User Experience Design of After-school Service System for Parents of Primary School Students,"With the proposal of the stress reduction policy for primary school students, the shortening of the time for primary school students to study in school, the issue of early after school in the afternoon has become a very controversial topic for parents and all walks of life, and many countries have issued policies related to after-school services. With the proposal of the stress reduction policy for primary school students, the shortening of the time for primary school students to study in school, the issue of early after school in the afternoon has become a very controversial topic for parents and all walks of life, and many countries have issued policies related to after-school services. On the basis of previous research, user experience elements are extracted: sensory experience, usefulness experience, usability experience, affective experience, Combined with the case study of ""Duosu Education"" after-school service system, a questionnaire survey was designed, and the importance and satisfaction differences of parents of primary school students to after-school service system were analyzed by using the material-performance analysis (IPA) method.
The results are as follows: parents are highly satisfied with the sensory experience (color collocation, interface layout, font size), usability experience (learnability, efficiency, memorability, error reduction), and emotional experience (friendliness, surprise, controllability) of the after-school service system. The satisfaction with the usefulness experience of the after-school service system (functional completeness and the matching degree of the system to meet the needs) is low.
Based on the research results and parents' satisfaction with the use of ""Duosu Education"" after-school service system, this study proposes a simple system design to optimize the user experience of parents in the after-school service system. It is hoped that this will provide theoretical support for the future optimization of after-school service systems.",2011

2024,Transforming Training: A Phenomenological Study of Person-Centered Thinking Trainers in Korea,"This phenomenological study investigates the transformative experiences of the first cohort of Person-Centered Thinking (PCT) trainers in South Korea, using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The research identifies four major themes―Ignition (the spark of change), Illumination (gaining new insights), Guidance (navigating progress), and Introspection (personal reflection and growth)―that outline the trainers’ journeys from traditional, rigid practices to more empathetic, person-centered approaches. Despite these transformative outcomes, the trainers encountered challenges in integrating PCT principles into Korea's collectivist culture and hierarchical systems. The study emphasizes the importance of systemic adaptation and culturally sensitive training to fully implement PCT in Korean human services. Recommendations include embedding PCT in policy, promoting cultural sensitivity in training, and providing continuous professional development to sustain person-centered practices.",1002
2024,The Ripple Effect of Real Estate Prices: A Case Study of the Beijing－Tianjin－Hebei Urban Agglomeration in China,"[Purpose]The purpose of this paper is to explore the ripple effect of house prices among individual cities in the Beijing－Tianjin－Hebei urban agglomeration.
[Methodology]This paper empirically studies the ripple effect of urban agglomeration on housing prices in cities in the region through methods such as cointegration test and vector error correction model.
[Findings]This paper studies that, first, in the long run, there is a cointegration relationship between the six cities; second, urban housing prices are not only affected by other cities but also related to their own accumulation effect; third, in the short－term, the cities most affected by the ripple effect are Langfang, Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and Tangshan, in that order.
[Implications]The innovation of this paper lies in the selection of the sample and the use of multiple methods, which make the conclusions more robust and provide guidance for policymakers on housing price control.",971
2024,Research on Brand Communication and Consumer Behavior of Pop-up Shops in the Context of Brand Semiotics,"This study focuses on pop-up shops as an emerging mode of brand communication, employing brand semiotics theory in combination with the S-O-R (Stimulus-Organism-Response) model to explore how brand symbols influence consumer behavior and brand communication outcomes. The research adopts an empirical approach, collecting data through questionnaires and applying regression analysis and mediation effect testing to examine the relationships among variables in the S-O-R model. A total of 210 valid responses were obtained. The results show that brand symbols, as external stimuli, have a significant positive impact on consumers’ perceptions of both quality value and emotional value. Moreover, perceived value further enhances consumers’ purchase intentions and brand loyalty, functioning as a mediator between brand symbols and consumer behavior. The study concludes that the effective use of multi-sensory symbols in pop-up shops not only attracts consumer attention but also strengthens brand loyalty and engagement, offering theoretical insights and practical guidance for optimizing brand marketing strategies.",1116
2024,Declining shorebirds on the EAAF: A flyway scale perspective on research topics,"South Korea’s Nakdong estuary (33 ° 15' N; 129 ° 10' E) lies near Pusan on the Korean Peninsula and the Yellow Sea, which is an important staging area for the millions of migrant shorebirds on the East Asian Australasian Flyway (EAAF). Many of these species show negative population trends, and several are listed as threatened, near-threatened and even endangered by the IUCN. Studies link the EAAF declines to the loss of stopover sites in the Yellow Sea, though according to Hua et al. (2015) solid evidence is lacking. Shorebirds on other flyways on the planet are in similar straits. A commentary published in Nature entitled ‘What’s killing the world’s shorebirds?’ (Munro 2017) lists possible causes as coastal development, climate change, hunting, and agricultural shifts – among others. Decades of research and multi-national investments have been devoted to this issue, but as Munro’s paper acknowledges, the underlying causes in many cases remain unclear. Such uncertainty in the face of such strong and widespread declines is very troubling.",1053

2024,Microbiological Investigation of Reusing Disposable Saliva Ejectors,"Objective: Dental instruments are often designed for single use; however, some dental clinics resort to reusing instruments, including saliva ejectors. In this study, we aimed to investigate and compare various disinfection and sterilization methods for contaminated disposable salivary ejectors. Methods: Saliva ejectors contaminated with Streptococcus mutans were divided into f ive groups: negative control, positive control, cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization. Surface contamination and microbial culture tests were conducted using the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) test and colony-forming units (CFUs) counting, respectively. One-way ANOVA was used to assess the differences among groups. Results: There were no significant differences among the cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization groups based on immediate ATP test. However, CFU counts were significantly higher in the cleaning and disinfection groups compared to negative control group, while no microbial growth was observed in the sterilization group. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that saliva ejectors harbor bacteria capable of growth, even after cleaning with a toothbrush or disinfectant. Autoclaving proved to be the most effective sterilization method, eliminating microbial growth, and allowing for microbiological reuse. Future studies involving diverse microorganisms and different types of contaminants are recommended.",1408

2024,Consumer Acceptance toward Internet Finance -A Comparative Study between China and the U.S.-,"This study conducts a comparative analysis of the internet finance sectors in China and the United States, with a specific focus on consumer acceptance of Internet Finance. As financial technology advances, traditional barriers within the financial industry are diminishing, facilitating greater consumer access to internet finance. China has emerged as a leader in this global trend, propelled by strong consumer demand. While various scholars have explored the reasons behind this phenomenon, our study seeks to investigate the underlying mechanisms influencing consumer willingness to adopt internet financial products and services in both countries. Through surveys and empirical analyses, we examine how consumers in China and the United States perceive and embrace internet finance. Our findings reveal that Chinese respondents generally exhibit a higher level of acceptance of the perceived usefulness of internet finance compared to their American counterparts, with no significant disparity in perceived ease of use. Conversely, American respondents display greater acceptance across the social, psychological, and perceived risk dimensions.
Furthermore, Chinese respondents demonstrate a stronger acceptance in terms of behavioral intention. Overall, while both Chinese and American consumers express concerns about the security of internet finance, Chinese consumers exhibit a higher degree of acceptance. This suggests that although consumers in both countries acknowledge the benefits of internet finance, perceived risk serves as a limiting factor for adoption, particularly among American consumers who show a lower inclination to adopt internet financial products and services compared to their Chinese counterparts. Our study offers insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders by delving into the dynamics of consumer acceptance and its impact on the development of internet finance.",1908
2024,Research on Multi-Vehicle and Multi-Task Route Planning for Autonomous Delivery Robots in Parks,"In the context of multi-vehicle and multi-task logistics distribution within a park, traditional algorithms are often hindered by high computational complexity and slow convergence rates. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has gained popularity in path planning for autonomous delivery vehicles due to its straightforward algorithmic principles, broad applicability, and comprehensive search capabilities.
However, the conventional PSO is susceptible to premature convergence, leading to local optima. To address this, this study incorporates the Tent map into the PSO to enhance the algorithm's global search ability and prevent premature convergence. Benchmark function tests demonstrate that the improved Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (TPSO), as proposed in this study, exhibits faster convergence and greater accuracy.In the instance verification section, X Park was selected as an example to construct a multi-vehicle and multi-task model for the logistics distribution within the park.
The TPSO algorithm proposed in this paper was used to solve the model, and finally, the superiority of the TPSO algorithm was verified through comparative simulation.",1165

2024,Exploring the Contextual Influence of Super PAC Contributions on Legislative Voting Behavior through Hierarchical Linear Modeling,"This paper is exploratory in nature which represents the first attempt to examine the influence relationship between Super PACs and legislative voting behavior using a Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM). Previous research had studied the relationship between PAC money, not Super PAC money and legislative voting behaviors based on regression models or mathematical models. In this study, the Oil & Gas sector was selected for HLM testing among PAC sectors, considering its significant scale. A key limitation in these single-level models is their failure to account for contextual factors, such as district interests, which may influence congressional voting decisions. Legislators’ choices cannot be entirely disentangled from the interests of their constituencies. The HLM approach enables this contextual analysis. I investigated the decision-making process of senators' voting through the relationships between Super PAC contributions and party affiliation at level 1 and district interests at level 2, using the information on the 116th and 117th the U.S. senators such as roll-call votes, Super PACs, party affiliations, ideologies, and district interests, assembling a longitudinal panel matrix. I tested 4 HLM models, and the findings indicate two primary outcomes. Firstly, the data affirm both central hypotheses, showing that state characteristics and district interests heavily influence senators' votes on oil and gas legislation, particularly as senators with more Super PAC funding are more likely to vote pro-industry. Secondly, the intercept-and-slope-as-outcome model (Model 4) proves to be the most effective, outperforming other models according to -2LL, AIC, and BIC criteria, highlighting the value of multilevel models in analyzing the effects of Super PAC contributions on voting behavior. In summary, the influence of Super PAC money on legislative voting behavior has been confirmed through the HLM approach; that is, the HLM approach has been confirmed as a useful model for explaining the impact of Super PAC money on legislative voting behavior.",2075
2024,Effect of RF Powers and O2 Flow Rates on Etch Rate of SiO2 with Reactive Ion Etching System,"As the size of semiconductor devices becomes smaller and more diverse materials are used, the precision of the etching process, selectivity depending on the type of material, and process reliability are becoming more important. In this study, we compared and analyzed the effects of RF Power and O2 on the etch rate of SiO2 material using the Reactive Ion Etching, RIE, system. The key parameters of the etching process can reduce the time and cost, and the productivity and reliability can be improved. The etch rate was varied greatly depending on RF power and O2 flow rate. When the RF power exceeds certain value, the increment of etch rate was getting smaller. Also, the etch rate was saturated when the flow rate of O2 exceeded the certain value.",752

2024,An Observational Study on the Residential Spaces and Behavioral Characteristics for Chinese Three-Generation Family Communication,"Amid China’s rapid development, accelerated urbanization, and widespread use of information technology, urban housing has become increasingly homogeneous. Unlike Western family cultures, East Asian cultures, particularly in China, have unique residential forms. Three-generation families remain common in East Asia, especially in China, but are often overlooked.
Recent Western cultural influences, rising housing prices, and pro-natalist policies have exacerbated their housing challenges, revealing that current designs do not fully accommodate their evolving needs.
This paper explores the lifestyles and needs of three-generation households in China through field surveys, semi-structured interviews, and video observations. By examining both tangible and intangible aspects of family culture, it identifies modern family values and proposes design directions that enhance communication and interaction in these households.
The study employs user-centered video observation to analyze family members' behaviors and psychological space needs. Video recordings of sample families were coded and analyzed using NOLDUS software. Results indicate that grandparents, who handle most household chores, have the least communication time, while children, who need the most communication, are least involved in chores. Additionally, grandparents' activities are confined to fixed areas, whereas parents and children use more varied spaces.
These findings help identify the values and behavior patterns of three-generation families, suggesting ways to improve their living conditions and providing valuable insights for researchers in the field.",1638
2024,Feasibility Study on the Integration of Traditional Chinese Culture into Game Design - Focused on Honor of Kings,"The gaming industry has developed rapidly in the Internet era, and the number of gaming users has skyrocketed. The worldviews created by games and the values they convey have had a subtle impact on the perceptions of gaming users. Their unique and innovative story settings, distinctive game themes, and outstanding character designs have made games a cultural symbol. Games have cultural and economic value and incorporate technological elements and Internet characteristics. Using the Internet to extend in multiple directions and actively engaging in cross-industry collaborations and cultural collaborations strengthens brand reputation and injects new vitality into cultural heritage. Taking advantage of the internationalization of the gaming industry and the characteristics of cross-border cooperation, traditional Chinese cultural elements can be incorporated into game design, enriching the core of the game and promoting cultural communication. This can also tap into a deeper level of users and provide new opportunities for cultural exchange and cross-border innovation.

2024,The Role of Social Capital in the Health Check-Up Service Utilization in China,"Using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), this study examines the relationship between social capital and the utilization of health check-up services among middle-aged and elderly individuals in China. To address potential biases arising from interdependence within the same community, this study employs a multilevel logistic regression model. The empirical results provide strong evidence that an individual’s social capital significantly enhances the likelihood of accessing health check-up services among this demographic. The study highlights two key aspects. First, individuals with robust social networks providing financial or care support are more likely to participate in health check-up services. Second, individuals engaged in social activities are more inclined to utilize health check-up services compared to those isolated from their families or communities. This suggests that individuals with strong social capital are more likely to seek preventive healthcare services, potentially reducing the risk of hospitalization and improving their overall quality of life. In addition, this study uncovers disparities in the utilization of health check-up services between urban and rural areas. This discrepancy emphasizes the necessity for specific public health initiatives in China.",1330
2024,A Study on the Weldability of Cylindrical Secondary Battery Material using Green Laser,"This study investigates a green laser welding on a nickel-coated copper-mild steel material used in an electric vehicle battery. The laser power and scan speed were varied, and through optical microscopy, it was demonstrated that excessive heat input led to increased weld penetration depth and bead width. Regarding defects, excessive heat input caused the formation of oxide, spatter on the bead surface, as well as porosity and cracks inside the weld penetration depth. The mechanical properties were evaluated through shear stress and microhardness measurements, indicating that as the heat input increased, the mechanical properties improved for the sample welded under the 2 kW condition. Considering the fire risk (occur at weld penetration depth over 50%) and joining aspects (start at weld penetration depth higher 20%), the optimal conditions were set as 1.6 kW and 300 mm/s. This optimized condition was set as the reference for monitoring.

2024,日本語の「うしろ」「あと」と韓国語の「뒤」「후」との対照研究,"본고는 일본어의“우시로(うしろ)”“아토(あと)”와 한국어의“뒤”“후”와의 의미와 기능에 있어서의 유사점과 차이점에 관하여 실제의 예문 분석을 통하여 고찰한 것이다. 본 논문의 고찰대상인 “우시로”와 “아토”에 대한 선행연구는 종래에 있었으나, 한국어와의 대조적인 관점에서, “뒤” ‘후“와의 유사점과 차이점에 대하여 상세히 언급한 연구는 보이지 않는다. 이에 따라 본고에서는 위와 같은 각각의 4가지 형식의 의미 및 기능을 기술하는 것을 목표로 했다. 그 결과는 다음과 같다. 첫째, “우시로”는 기본적으로 공간만을 나타낸다. 전접명사에는 사물명사, 사람명사 등이 사용되고 술어는 취하는 격에 따라 정해진 타입이 사용된다. 다양한 격의 형태를 취할 수 있다. 기능적으로는 형식명사의 역할을 한다. 둘째, “아토”는 공간과 시간의 양쪽을 나타낸다. 공간의 경우는 전접명사에 사람명사가 사용되고 고정화된 술어가 사용되는 특징이 보인다. 시간의 경우는 전접명사에 시간명사와 동작성명사가 사용되고 술어의 타입은 제한이 없어진다. 셋째, “뒤”는공간과 시간의 양쪽을 나타낸다. 공간의 경우는 전접명사에 사물명사, 사람명사 등이 사용되고 술어는 정해진 타입이 사용된다. 다양한 격의 형태를 취할 수 있다. 기능적으로는 형식명사의 역할을 한다. 시간의 경우는 전접명사에 시간명사가 사용되고 술어의 타입은 제한이 없어진다. 넷째, “후”는 기본적으로 시간만을 나타낸다. 전접명사에 시간명사와 동작성명사가 사용되고 술어의 타입은 제한이 없어진다. 이상을 요약하면, 의미적으로는“우시로”는공간만을 나타내는 반면“뒤”는 공간과 시간의 양쪽을 나타낸다. 한편, “아토”는 공간과 시간의 양쪽을 나타내는 반면 “후”는 시간만을 나타낸다. 즉, 일본어와 한국어에서 각각의 형식이 담당하는 의미영역이 다르다고 말할 수 있다. 기능적으로는“우시로”와“뒤”가 공간을 나타내는 경우는 기본적으로 형식명사로 기능하지만 그 밖의 경우는 기능적인 추상화가 일어난다.",967
2024,Α study on the diversification of Interpretation according to the Bible didactics by Horst Klaus Berg,"This study seeks to shed light on the contributions of Horst Klaus Berg to German Bible didactics, underscoring the pivotal role of diverse interpretative approaches in the teaching and learning of the Bible. In an era where the complexities and intricacies of the Bible present significant challenges to contemporary readers, the prevalence of one-dimensional interpretations further obstructs the pathway to a profound comprehension of the spiritual depth embedded within its texts. By centering on Horst Klaus Berg’s influential theories in the field of German Bible didactics, this research delves into the impact of varied biblical interpretations on Christian education. Berg’s work is celebrated for its insightful strategies, notably his advocacy for comprehensive interpretative methods such as “Railway Tracks” and “Free-Learning.” These approaches seek to reconcile traditional biblical teachings with individual experiences, thereby facilitating a more expansive understanding of the Bible’s applicability to modern life. Through a detailed examination of Berg’s theory on biblical interpretation, this paper argues that Christian education must prioritize the cultivation of diverse interpretative skills and their practical integration into Bible study. This educational model encourages learners to become active interpreters, capable of discerning the text’s deep-seated meanings by relating it to their personal experiences. The study concludes by affirming Berg’s delineation of three critical tasks in biblical interpretation: “reciprocal interpretation,” “acknowledgment of the biblical texts’ diversity,” and “free learning.” These elements are portrayed as interrelated and essential, reinforcing Berg’s proposition that understanding the Bible’s complexity and diversity is crucial for advancing Christian education. This paper offers a novel perspective on the significance of embracing multifaceted interpretations within the domain of biblical studies.",1978
2024,Exploring Stylistic Alignment in L2 Conversation,"This study investigated whether linguistic alignment occurs at the stylistic level in natural conversations involving L2 learners. Specifically, the study examined the degree to which various lexical features were differentially aligned in dialogue between L2-L1 and L2-L2 dyads and which factors affected the magnitude of stylistic alignment. The degree of stylistic alignment was quantified using a language style matching metric. The study analyzed a corpus of 167 transcribed conversations using a computational tool. Findings demonstrated that stylistic alignment took place to a greater extent in the L2-L2 dyad than in the L2-L1 dyad in the choice of the four lexical features. However, L2-L1 dyads used more sophisticated words, which may in turn potentially contribute to word learning during natural conversations. The significant effects of group membership, familiarity between interlocutors, and proficiency differences on stylistic alignment are also discussed.",975

2024,Analyzing Public Access and Boundary Utilization in Landscape Architecture,"(Background and Purpose) In contemporary society, Landscape Architecture crucially addresses the relationships between architecture and landscape, as well as individual and public realms within cities, establishing boundaries as areas with potential for communication while maintaining continuity between buildings and land. Despite the existence of developments ranging from single buildings to large-scale urban projects, many boundary and green spaces are currently applied in cities in isolated and passive ways, with limited functionality in terms of accessibility and publicness. Furthermore, the potential of Landscape Architecture to function diversely within urban environments is underutilized due to a lack of research on its boundary components and methods, compounded by uniform regulations. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes using the boundary spaces of buildings as a solution to practical urban problems, examining the construction methods and components of Landscape Architecture's boundary spaces to advance the concept of 'publicness' in both current and future architectural developments. (Method) This research employs case studies to examine the integration methods of Landscape Architecture within urban conditions, leveraging landscape concepts to bridge diverse aspects and elements. The study emphasizes the critical elements of Landscape Architecture, such as the rates of 'open area' and 'openness,' by investigating international architectural projects. These case studies are instrumental in understanding the types, access, efficiency, and rates of open areas, which are pivotal in expressing the public usage of Landscape Architectures numerically. (Results) The boundary spaces of Landscape Architecture, reflecting the urban context and locality, have shown high potential for public use and were categorized for analysis accordingly. This study introduced an innovative 'publicness graph,' linking objective indicators like 'public area ratio' and 'openness' to visualize detailed characteristics. By defining the Public Occupancy Index (POI) and Balance Deviation Index (BDI), the study quantitatively categorized the 'publicness' of individual buildings, which had previously been expressed qualitatively. (Conclusions) The study concludes that Landscape Architecture holds the potential to revolutionize the design and functionality of public spaces within urban landscapes. Through case analysis and conceptual establishment of the use of boundary spaces in landscape architecture, a quantitative analysis method has been presented. By applying the types of 'Street type', 'Park type', and 'Street + Park type' as case studies, the validity of the analytical method that quantifies the individual characteristics of buildings associated with publicness proposed in this paper has been confirmed. The analysis method based on the 'Publicness Graph' is expected to contribute significantly to the development of design plans and models that can optimize the public use of increasingly complex boundary spaces in modern architecture.",3078
2024,A Study on The Self-identity in Role-playing Games - Focused on Lacan’s Psychoanalysis,"As today’s ""ninth art"", role-playing games recognized by most players due to their surreal themes and sustained reflection on social diseases. Through precise control of story-telling and game visuals, players develop an avatar identification during role-playing game. Based on Lacan's mirror stage theory, a new self-identity mechanism is established under the guidance of role-playing games. As a ""player"", the subject's interpretation of himself is shifted by the game order, and the subject identifies with the role-playing game while at the same time being structured by the desire of role-playing game. The immersive experience and emotional guidance of role-playing games all point to the most instinctive human desires. The psychoanalytic theory from Lacan's perspective explains the source of players' desire, and the expression of players' desire in the game. It also plays an important role in the emotional rendering and identity aspects of role-playing games. This paper is to establish that role-playing games do have an impact on the player's self-identity through a Lacanian psychoanalytic reading of role-playing games.",1136
2024,Impact of Digital Literacy Level on Practicum Courses in Distance Education,"This study aims to analyze the impact of digital literacy level on students taking practicum courses at an open and distance university. Thus, differences in digital literacy competency were investigated using an online survey of 423 students.

2024,A Study on the Arrangement of Mooring system at the Quay-type LNG terminal in Ulsan Port,"Recently, the interest in eco-friendly energy sources, including liquefied natural gas (LNG), has considerably increased both domestically and internationally, and the development of LNG-handling facilities and berths is actively underway. Ulsan Port has been selected as a Northeast Asian oil and energy hub and is actively developing LNG and oil storage facilities and berths. The LNG terminal currently under construction in the North Port district of Ulsan New Port is a quay-type terminal rather than a dolphin-type terminal, which is the existing main-pier type. However, no domestic or international design standards for the mooring-system arrangement of quay-type LNG terminals exist. Therefore, in this study, to establish design standards for mooring systems for quay-type LNG terminals, we developed a pier that reflected the dolphin-type mooring system arrangement in the Harbour and Fishery Design Criteria and analyzed the sensitivity of mooring-evaluation parameter for actual target berthing vessels. The results showed that, compared to the mooring system arrangement of the existing quay-type pier, the tension of the mooring line, load of the QRH, reaction force of the fender, and ship motion of 6-DOF were generally reduced under the same environmental conditions, which are beneficial for improving ship and pier safety. The results of this study offer a foundation for developing design standards for quay-type LNG terminals.",1448
2024,Study on Minimizing Electromagnetic Interference to Capture Vortex Structures in Turbulent Boundary Layer,"To measure the vortex structures within the turbulent boundary layer, a hot-wire sensor was mounted on a stepper motor controller and moved to the designated measurement points. Near the surface within the flow field, the velocity is relatively slow, making the measurements highly sensitive to electromagnetic interference (EMI) during signal processing. This EMI primarily originates from the power supplies of computers and other electronic equipment. In our experimental setup, EMI was introduced into BNC cables connected to the hot-wire sensor from the powered stepper motor. When power was supplied to the motor controller to move the hot-wire sensor, EMI appeared on the oscilloscope screen. Consequently, unexpected noise was present in the data measured by the hot-wire sensor. To mitigate this and enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) during measurements, the connecting cables were shielded, and an old computer without EMI shielding was replaced.",962

2024,Enhancing Listening Comprehension through Repetitive Listening Practice —A Strategy-Based Approach—,"This study investigates the effects of five-time repetitive listening practice, in which 116 college students have employed various listening strategies in augmenting listening comprehension and the overall listening process. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted to explore the impact of this approach.
The results indicate a marginal increase in mean scores from pre-listening to post-listening tests, albeit lacking numerical significance, suggesting limited improvement potentially due to participants’ inadequate engagement in the practice.
However, the participants strongly acknowledged the effectiveness of repetitive listening practice, rating all five strategies including attentive listening, listening with the script, simultaneous reading aloud and listening, note-taking, and note revision through re-listening highly, with “note revision through re-listening” emerging as the most useful. Moreover, there was a notable shift from a “medium” to a “high” level of strategy use following instruction. Qualitative data from the participants’ reflections revealed favorable reactions, highlighting the promotion of self-reflection and autonomy in study approaches, alongside enhanced metacognitive awareness in English listening. Despite its limitations, the current study has offered a strategy-based-repetitive listening guide that can be easily integrated in college English courses.

2024,Analyzing Factors Affecting Consumer Emotions: Case of Life Insurance Data in Korea,"This study aimed to identify the influencing factors and correlations that are highly related to consumer emotions. Voice data from the call center of a large Korean life insurance company was utilized to ascertain the positive and negative emotions of customers. It was found that positive emotions are closely related to insurance churn indicators. Therefore, the characteristics of consumers related to their emotional tendencies were quantified by using the data on whether they canceled their services as a proxy for positive emotions and applying machine learning techniques to analyze the attributes of canceled customers. The results indicate that consumers are more likely to cancel insurance services if they are older, female, married, have large assets, have low income, receive frequent contract counseling or new product offers, and have multiple products. These characteristics are indicative of a more negative emotional disposition. The significance of this study lies in its adoption of a quantitative paradigm beyond the traditional survey-based emotion assessment approach. From a practical perspective, it provides domestic insurance companies with reliable information on customer dispositions, which can be used to inform their customer retention strategies. Furthermore, the study offers insights that can be applied across various disciplines related to the analysis of individual emotions, including business, psychology, education, and sociology.",1473

2024,A Study on the Conflict Between the Anti-discrimination Laws and the Freedom of Expressive Association in the United States,"The First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees a person with the freedom of expression under which the person has a right to freely express his opinions and beliefs. One of the ways to express oneself is by joining as a member an association, the organizational purposes and mission of which he agrees and supports. An association and its members can claim under the freedom of expressive association that they have the constitutional right to decide the association’s membership composition in which they can deny membership privilege to individuals whom they wish to exclude as new members which is called the “negative right.” Such negative right can be claimed only if the association is an intimate or private association rather than a public accommodation or public association in nature, and the association has expressive purposes and messages.
On the other hand, the state governments have enacted the anti-discrimination laws to prohibit associations from discriminating against people on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, or gender, etc. The government can claim that they have a compelling interest in eradicating associational discrimination by preventing them from refusing to give membership privilege on the basis of invidious classifications. The issue here is whether the government under its anti-discrimination laws can force an association to admit individuals that the association wishes to exclude by exercising its negative right under the freedom of expressive association.
When the anti-discrimination laws can adversely affect the fundamental right such as the freedom of expression and association, the laws must satisfy the strict scrutiny test in which the anti-discrimination law must be based on a compelling interest and must be narrowly tailored to achieve its compelling interest. In determining whether the governmental action at issue is unconstitutional in interfering with an association’s freedom of expressive association, the U.S. Supreme Court in a series of cases applied the balancing of interest test under which the Court evaluates the competing interests between the government’s compelling interest and association’s negative right. The determinations of whether a governmental law is narrowly tailored as well as whose interest is more important both depend on whether the government uses the least restrictive means in executing its anti-discrimination law. The determination of that question at the same time would require answering whether the execution of anti-discrimination law would have a detrimental effect on an association’s mission and purposes, interfering with the association’s freedom of expressive association.
This article proposes several methods which the courts can use in resolving the above issue. The most decisive factor to be considered seems to be whether an association’s membership composition is essential to a particular identity and purpose of the association. If an association can prove that the forced inclusion of certain individuals would alter the core identity and expressive purpose of the association in an irreversibly detrimental way, the protection of its constitutional freedom of expressive association must be given priority. Lastly, this article is to discuss and analyze the gender and racial discrimination in Korea in an attempt to draw the comparison between the American perspectives and the Korean perspectives on gender and racial issues.",3467
2024,Why Do Students Drop Out of High School?: The Case Study of Kasi District in Lao PDR,"Purpose: This study explored why high school students decided to drop out in rural area of Lao PDR and further aimed to propose possible prevention to improve the drop out situation of the countries.
Originality: Previous research that primarily focused on specific factors and dropout rate cannot explained why students decided to leave high school in early grade. Therefore, using comprehensive framework including individual and institutional factors, this study examined the dropout factors from individual perspective in qualitative way.
Methodology: The study uses an explanatory sequential mixed method approach that employs both a questionnaire and interviews. Total 30 participants engaged in interviews including students and their parents, teachers and governmental officials. A thematic analysis was utilized for data analysis.
Result: The results highlight that at the individual level, such as lack of motivation, peer pressure, early marriage, and cultural norms, pose barriers to high school attendance. Low household income and negative family dynamics also contribute significantly to dropout rates, with agricultural demands and family particular situations. Insufficient school resources, including materials and extracurricular activities, along with a shortage of qualified teachers, affect student engagement. Additionally, the community's low human and social capital increase dropout rates by limiting employment opportunities.
Conclusions and Implication: The results indicated that both individual and institutional factors played a role in the dropout decision-making process. Furthermore, they suggested essential considerations such as examining job prospects for high school graduates in the local community, and evaluating the availability of resources within the school and community to assist students at risk of dropping out.",1860

In order to help scholars from all over the world grasp the development context and trends of dance therapy research in China, this research analyzes the relevant literature on dance therapy in the China National Knowledge Infrastructure(CNKI) database, revealing the research trends of dance therapy theme in the past 30 years, which can give data support for related research and provide theoretical basis for scholars around all over the world, and promote international academic exchanges and cooperation. Through the knowledge graph analysis method, the high-frequency words and high centrality words of 402 literature were explored and analyzed, and the knowledge network graph of dance therapy was presented from five aspects. It was found that, the research of dance therapy topics has gradually evolved in three stages in the past 30 years in China. On the whole, early research mainly focused on the role of dance in rehabilitation treatment, and mainly focused on the treatment of elderly. In recent years, with the focus on dance therapy and in-depth practice, emerging research topics involve the treatment of ‘depression’, ‘anxiety’, ‘stroke’, etc., which more pay attention to students, autistic children, and other groups. It shows that, with the increasing in research and attention on the field of dance therapy in China, the research not only focuses on dance therapy, but also involves many related fields, such as psychotherapy and self-acceptance in different groups, which shows that keeps expanding the research's progress and application of dance therapy in China. However, it also reflects the problems of incomplete operation system and insufficient academic-industrial linkage in Chinese dance therapy. This study is expected to provide implications for the direction of development of Chinese dance therapy to scholars around the world, including Korea.",2032
2024,Investigating Soft Budget Constraints in a Transition Economy: The Case of Angolan Banks,"This study analyzes the effect of soft budget constraints from the perspective of firm ownership structure. The contribution of this study is that it analyzes soft budget constraints, firm value and ownership structure in a unified model, while previous studies have analyzed them independently. This integrated model gives us a better understanding of the impact channel of SBC on firm value. Using a sample of Angolan banks from 2015 to 2020, we find a significant negative relationship between government ownership and firm cash holdings, confirming the existence of soft budget constraints in Angolan banks. We also find a significant negative relationship between government ownership and firm value (Tobin's Q) and operating performance (ROE). In addition, we find that there is a significant positive relationship between institutional ownership and firm value. The result suggests that the monitoring function of external institutional investors can be effective even for firms in transition economies with high government ownership.",1041
2024,中国《民法典》格式条款效力规则的问题及完善,"格式条款是由一方当事人预先拟定且未与相对人协商，相对人只能选 择接受或拒绝的条款. 随着互联网的快速发展，格式条款的使用进一步扩 大，随之而来，也产生了一些问题. 2022年8月18日，《中国消费者报》推 出不公平格式条款调查系列报道，调查显示87.88%的消费者遇到过不公 平格式条款. 2023年2月，《中国消费者报》对中国消费者协会点评过的 部分不公平格式条款进行回顾调查，发现部分企业依然使用不公平格式 条款. 因此，对于格式条款进行有效规制十分必要. 中国《民法典》也关 注到这一问题，《民法典》第497条对无效格式条款进行了规定，相较原 《合同法》发生了一些变化. 《民法典》第497条第2项增加了合理性审查 要求，在表达上增加了“减轻其责任”、“加重对方责任”的情形，对格式条 款的无效类型进行了更为细致的分类. 使得原《合同法》第40条后半部分 内容由“含混”变得“有层次”，由“僵化”变得“灵活”. 然而整体上相比于域外 法中成体系化的、规则丰富的、实用性强的格式条款效力规则，中国原 《合同法》及新近《民法典》均只有寥寥一条规范，无疑相形寡漏，实 用性太弱. 在此立法背景下，需进一步加强对格式条款效力规则的研究.
目前，中国格式条款效力规则主要由《民法典》、《消费者权益保护 法》、《电子商务法》等法律及一系列司法解释组成. 根据法律评价的结 果，格式条款的效力形态分为四种类型：效力待定、可撤销、无效、有 效. 在中国的现行法律中，没有关于格式条款可撤销与效力待定情形的专 门规定，该两种情形适用于民事法律行为效力的一般规定. 本文通过实践 及理论研究，发现中国格式条款效力规则存在审查标准内涵不明确、效 力认定路径存在分歧、效力认定基准适用存在分歧、未区分用户进行给 付均衡度审查等问题. 对此，可通过明确审查标准、理清格式条款效力认定路径、明确效力认定基准的选择、区分用户进行给付均衡度审查等措 施予以完善.",818
2024,Study on NFT-Blockchain-Based Incentive Mechanism for Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks,"This study presents an incentive mechanism that explores the integration of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and blockchain in the context of Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs). It utilizes NFTs and the smart contract technology to address the challenges for data sharing in vehicle, which are exacerbated by high-speed movement and unstable networks. The core premise in this study is that the data which is collected by vehicles; it is transformed in valuable assets. Data gathered through a smart contract is converted into NFTs which is enabling real compensation for vehicle users. A noteworthy aspect of this system is its automated process, ensuring that each step is transparent and secure. This guarantees fair compensation provided by vehicle drivers which is expected to enhance participation and efficiency within the VANETs in the future. In this paper, it proposes a new paradigm for the future traffic data, moving beyond a simple technical proposal. It advocates for a cooperative and efficient VANETs by redefining the value of data and offering tangible incentives to participants.",1093
2024,“Registers of Empathy” and “Ideas of Care” at Independence Hall of Korea,"According to Morse (2020), it is significant to acknowledge the idea of ‘care for people’ within museums and heritage sites in post-covid 19 period and, in turn, to revive their ability to generate societal value in the twenty-first century. In order to understand this new social value that is created within museums, it is necessary to understand ‘people’, and my specific focus here which is on ‘visitors’, asking what they are doing and how they make meaning, particularly towards difficult history. This article begins by briefly introducing the result of my empirical study at Independence Hall of Korea, (which forms part of my PhD research), and using it as a case study to demonstrate how South Korean visitors empathetically engage with Japanese colonial period history. In order to this, qualitative interview was conducted with 20 South Korean visitors and the critical analysis of the author as a critical visitor will be included. By doing so, it not only expands our understanding of South Korean visitors’ various empathetic engagements within museums, but also suggests and stimulates new theoretical and conceptual ways to think and understand the social role of museum and heritage sites through notions of ‘registers of empathy’ and ‘ideas of care’.",1269

2024,A Comparative Study of Chinese and Korean Book Cover Designs Using the “Most Beautiful Books” as Examples,"Books, the oldest form of cultural communication, are repositories of ideas and knowledge. In this context, book covers play an important role as a visual gateway between readers and the content. In the context of globalization, book cover designs vary across countries, and styles from China and Korea, in particular, often contain visual expressions of the deep cultural heritage and aesthetic concepts of the country. This study combines qualitative and quantitative analyses to examine a Chinese and Korean sample of the “Best Book Design from All Over The World” and subjectively compares the color, graphics, text, and other design elements of the book covers. Furthermore, it uses the powerful data processing and analysis functions of the R programming language to conduct a statistical, quantitative, and comparative analysis of book cover designs from China and Korea. Results show that book cover designs in Korea tend to favor a modern and minimalist style, emphasizing functionality and intuitiveness, whereas Chinese covers lean more toward integrating artistic elements with traditional aesthetics. The cultural and aesthetic concepts behind the differences are then explored from the perspectives of language, writing system, historical tradition, and aesthetic preference.",1289
2024,A Brief Discussion on the Registration-Based IPO System in China,"In June 2019, the Science and Technology Innovation Board (STAR Market) of the Shanghai Stock Exchange was officially established, marking the inception of the pilot stock issuance registration-based system in China. By February 2023, the comprehensive registration-based system was fully implemented, signaling the end of the long-standing chartered system in China's new stock issuance market. This transition from a chartered system to a registration-based system aligns with China's economic restructuring, comprehensive reform efforts, and the maturation of its capital markets. The full adoption of the registration-based system in China's stock market is a pivotal measure for developing direct financing, fostering a healthy cycle between industry and finance, and is significant for the high-quality development of China's economy in the future. From 1990 to 2023, China's capital market has evolved through approval-based system, chartered system, and registration-based system, with the latter gradually forming a multi-tiered capital market over five years, promoting rapid growth of the private economy and increasing the proportion of direct financing. However, since the implementation of the registration-based system, several issues have been exposed, such as insufficient and incomplete information disclosure, singular listing conditions, and lax regulation. Going forward, to scientifically promote the healthy development of a capital market with Chinese characteristics, China's stock market registration-based system should adhere to the following strategic orientations. The first is to consistently maintain the information disclosure system, the second is to continually improve listing standards, the third is to enhance delisting efficiency, and the fourth is to constantly strengthen the construction of capital market regulations. As the registration-based reform continues, China's capital market has progressively entered an important phase of building a modern capital market with Chinese characteristics. The reform has moved from localized trials to comprehensive implementation, as China strives to create a standardized, transparent, open, dynamic, and resilient capital market.",2215
2024,A Study on the Trends of Indoor Community Facilities in Seoul Apartments - Focusing on Northern Seoul Cases -,"(Background and Purpose) Rapid urbanization and increasing population density have driven significant transformations in residential typologies. In South Korea, this has led to the prominence of multi-family housing, particularly apartment complexes, as the predominant residential form. This trend is a response to the growing demand for spatial efficiency and living convenience, leading to the evolution of apartments from simple living spaces into residential complexes that incorporate a variety of community facilities. The Total Amount System of Community Facilities, implemented in 2013, has promoted the diversification and upscale development of community facilities in apartment complexes. These changes have become key factors in enhancing residents' quality of life and supporting the formation of social relationships. Based on this context, this study aims to analyze the spatial changes in community facilities in apartment complexes in Northern Seoul, with the objective of identifying the trajectory of residential development in South Korea. (Method) Northern Seoul, a region where traditional and modern residential spaces coexist, is ideal for studying the characteristics of typical Korean apartments. Therefore, this study focuses on newly constructed apartment complexes with over 150 units, completed after 2015, in this area. The selected complexes are primarily branded apartments built by top construction companies, ensuring technical reliability. Data were collected from major real estate databases, building registries, on-site surveys, promotional materials, and interviews with key stakeholders. The study conducted both quantitative and qualitative analyses to examine the changes in the area and composition of community facilities. (Results) The analysis of 22 apartment complexes in Northern Seoul revealed a continuous increase in the area of community facilities since 2015, with an average of 13 facilities per unit observed, particularly after 2020. Among these, wellness facilities constituted 57% of the total, indicating a growing emphasis on health and quality of life. The diversity of community facilities has increased regardless of the complex size. However, a relative decrease in facility area per unit was observed in larger complexes, attributed to the improved efficiency of collective facility designs. (Conclusions) This study demonstrates that the evolution of community facilities in apartment complexes plays a significant role in enhancing the quality of life in modern residential spaces. Since the implementation of the Total Amount System of Community Facilities, the expansion and sophistication of these facilities have promoted the development of residential environments focused on wellness, social interaction, and enrichment. Additionally, family and convenience facilities have increased. The findings confirm that providing diverse facilities is essential in modern urban housing. These results suggest that Korean apartments are evolving beyond mere living spaces into multifaceted environments that support both convenience and social connectivity. Future residential design should increasingly emphasize the importance of tailoring community facilities to regional characteristics and resident needs.",3275
2024,"Bio-efficacy Evaluation of “Diniconazole (Binnari) and Paclobutrazol” Kimchi Cabbage (Brassica rapa, subsp. pekinensis)","Bio-efficacies of two different types of fungicides, Diniconazole and Paclobutrazol with their effects as plant growth regulators for Kimchi Cabbage were evaluated on February 4 to April 13, 2024 in Los Baños, Laguna, Philippines. The experiment was done during the off-season planting of Kimchi Cabbage in the country. Yield and other horticultural characteristics were observed for seven dif ferent groups: group 1, untreated control; group 2, recommended rate of granular fertilizer (RR-G); group 3, recommended rate of granular fertilizer plus recommended rate of Diniconazole; group 4, rec ommended rate of Diniconazole (alone); group 5, recommended rate of Paclobutrazol (RR-PBZ), group 6, RR-G plus RR-PBZ; and group 7, RR-G plus ½ RR-PBZ. Results showed that combination of recom mended rate of granular fertilizer plus the full recommendation of Paclobutrazol (group 6) resulted in a significantly higher yield of 64.9 tons/ha than other groups with yields ranging from 23.3 to 55.3 tons/ha. Such significantly higher yield in group 6 was also attributed to the number of leaves produced by plants at the time of harvest. Regarding effects of two chemical treatments, the combination of Diniconazole and Paclobutrazol as recommended granular fertilizers helped in the heading of Kimchi Cabbage during hot conditions with an average temperature of 32-35°C from March to April at the heading stage plus a factor of being planted at a lowland area in the country. The advantage of Paclobutrazol aside from yield is its availability in the country as compared to Diniconazole (Binnari).",1591

2024,"A Study on Representation of Light in the Digital Video Lotus Garden, 1899 Using a Game Engine – Focusing on the Visual Characteristics of Monet's Impressionist Works","The advent of photography in the 19th century deepened artists' exploration of realism, light, and color, and Monet was a representative painter of Impressionism, seeking a new aesthetic through the change of light and time. <Lotus Garden, 1899> (2023) is a digital image reproduction of Monet's light expression using Unreal Engine 5, which is used as a game engine, and was selected as the outstanding student work by Epic Games by Epic Games Unreal Challenge and 2024 GDC Unreal Creator Showcase. Based on the research of Kang Seok-beom and Jeon Byeong-ho (2006), who defined the contact point between Monet's painting and photographic medium as 'light' and analyzed the image characteristics revealed in the work, this study presented a method of classifying Monet's main light expression characteristics into four categories and implementing them as Unreal Engine 5 through the case of <Lotus Garden, 1899>. The key implementation methods includes the following: first, representation of light over time, where the Ultra Dynamic Sky system was utilized to simulate atmospheric conditions and changes in solar altitude according to the time of day; second, light scattering, achieved through the Post Processing Layer to create dramatic effects of intense sunlight; third, capturing motion through photographic techniques, by employing out-focusing and full-shot techniques, implemented using a Cine Camera; and fourth, visualization, where light representation was visualized using Sequencer.",1497
2024,GDP deflator and CPI inflations: A Reason of their differences,"The CPI and GDP deflator are the two most common choices of inflation measure. The different ways of measuring inflation in CPI and GDP deflator could lead to the difference between them. According to the IMF IFS data of 49 countries, the correlations between the GDP deflator and CPI inflation vary by country. The correlation coefficients between CPI and GDP deflator inflation are from -0.058 to 0.982. We also observe at least one period when the GDP deflator and CPI move in opposite directions in every country. The panel regression of 49 countries' CPI on the expenditure parts deflator inflations yields the statistically significant positive estimated coefficients of the private consumption, investments, and import. The panel regression of GDP deflator inflation on the expenditure parts deflator inflations yields the statistically significantly positive estimated coefficients with private consumption, investment, government expenditure, and exports deflator inflations and a negative estimated coefficient with imports deflator inflation. The import deflator inflation was the only cause that statistically significantly increased the difference between CPI and the GDP deflator inflations. Since the GDP deflator and CPI respond differently with each other to import price changes, the import deflator inflation increases the difference between CPI and the GDP deflator inflations.",1397

2024,Information Asymmetry and Politicians’ Investment Behaviors: Evidence from the Korean National Assembly,"This study examines the effect of access to the privileged information on personal asset portfolio returns of Korean National Assembly members. Using unique and rich dataset, we show that high accessibility of the privileged information about national policies is positively related to personal asset portfolio returns. However, we also find that for each member, their first initiation of financial disclosure (the details of their personal asset portfolio) to the public negatively affects their share of risky assets in their personal portfolio. Lastly, our empirical results suggest that personal interests of the members may cause their voting decision when passing important bills that are closely related to the real estate markets or financial markets. Overall, our empirical results suggest that the privileges of the National Assembly members can improve their personal asset portfolio returns, although they are more risk-averse than before the initiation of public financial disclosure. This study contributes to the literature by examining the influence of privileged information on personal asset portfolio returns.",1129
2024,Research on the Process and Mechanism of Expanding Influence through social Franchise Mode of Social Enterprises in China,"Social enterprises have emerged to provide innovative solutions to ever-existing social problems onthe basis of the market, gradually introducing franchising as a way to strategically expand socialinfluence. However, in spite of its significance, sufficient review has yet been made on the practicemethods and concrete process of this, and few researches have been conducted on socialenterprises in China, whose scale and influence are limited. In order to review the mechanism onthe development process of social franchising in Chinese social enterprises, semi-structuredin-depth interviews were conducted on four representative social enterprises that applied socialfranchising methods in China, using embedded multi-case analysis method. Early education, welfarefor the elderly, and job-integrated social enterprises were closely examined for their social franchisedevelopment process, and as a result, they showed similar aspects to commercial franchises in theprocedures of partner selection, contract conclusion and management, etc., but differed greatly inthe practical content and use of the brand, management and compliance, and other considerationsincluding the ultimate goal.

2024,Perioperative adverse cardiac events and mortality after non-cardiac surgery: a multicenter study,"Background: Perioperative adverse cardiac events (PACE), a composite of myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, congestive heart failure, arrhythmic attack, acute pulmonary embolism, cardiac arrest, and stroke during 30-day postoperative period, is associated with long-term mortality, but with limited clinical evidence. We compared long-term mortality with PACE using data from nationwide multicenter electronic health records.Methods: Data from 7 hospitals, converted to Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model, were used. We extracted records of 277,787 adult patients over 18 years old undergoing non-cardiac surgery for the first time at the hospital and had medical records for more than 180 days before surgery. We performed propensity score matching and then an aggregated meta‑analysis.Results: After 1:4 propensity score matching, 7,970 patients with PACE and 28,807 patients without PACE were matched. The meta‑analysis showed that PACE was associated with higher one-year mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.33, 95% CI [1.10, 1.60], P = 0.005) and higher three-year mortality (HR: 1.18, 95% CI [1.01, 1.38], P = 0.038). In subgroup analysis, the risk of one-year mortality by PACE became greater with higher-risk surgical procedures (HR: 1.20, 95% CI [1.04, 1.39], P = 0.020 for low-risk surgery; HR: 1.69, 95% CI [1.45, 1.96], P < 0.001 for intermediate-risk; and HR: 2.38, 95% CI [1.47, 3.86], P = 0.034 for high-risk).Conclusions: A nationwide multicenter study showed that PACE was significantly associated with increased one-year mortality. This association was stronger in high-risk surgery, older, male, and chronic kidney disease subgroups. Further studies to improve mortality associated with PACE are needed.",1764
2024,A Study on the Location Error Reduction Method of GPS-based Augmented Reality App. - A Research Focused on Miracle Game -,"This paper investigates the incremental “distance difference” between the point on a display where an object should be created to where it is actually created on GPS-based AR (Augmented Reality) apps. This virtual gap, however small, is an issue for accuracy and user satisfaction. To correct this inaccuracy, a reduction method is offered here to reduce it. To this end, the researcher has developed a prototype AR game called “Miracle” to simulate adjustment differences through the basic game premise where the user saves cartoon ducks through location hunting. The impetus, therefore, for developing this game takes a different anaytical direction compared to other analyses of the social, cultural or political elements found in the popular AR mobile game “Pokemon Go” developed in 2016. By focusing specifically on GPS and topographical methods, this article will elaborate and offer solutions to spatial, programming, and technological glitches that made game play difficult on “Pokemon Go.” To enable this outcome, a series of tests were administered by the author through their amateur build “Miracle” game. After several tests were concluded the results offer several solutions through an error reduction method.",1222

There are no cytotoxicity at 100μg/mL of extracts except for hexane extract. Inhibitory production of inducible nitric oxide synthase increased with increasing concentration regardless of extract. In particular, when methanol and hot water extract concentration increased from 50μg/mL to 100μg/mL, they were increased from 14.4% to 34.2% and 11.9% to 30.7%, respectively. TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 expressions showed the best production inhibition effect in methanol and hot water extracts. In particular, the methanol extract showed a 33.6%, 23.5% and 26.7%, respectively. In the case of hot water extract, they showed 30.2%, 22.2%, and 25.4%, respectively. The nitrite scavenging activity was the highest as 65.3% in methanol extract. Ammonium oxidation using the water extract had a high value of 26.7 mg/ kg. In the case of nitrite oxidation, it was 25.8 mg/kg in the water extract. These results indicated that Camellia assamica root extracts may be a potential anti-inflammatory therapeutic agent due to the significant effects on inflammatory activities.",1207
2024,An Exploratory Study on University Students’ Perceptions Toward English Learning Through Using Authentic Audio-Visual Materials,"The advantages of the use of authentic materials are well established in the foreign language classroom. The present study aims to examine Korean university students' perceptions of authentic audio-video materials in language learning. It explores how students view these materials' impact on their language acquisition and related skill development. 49 participants for this study were students from a local university in Korea, indicating an intermediate language proficiency level. They utilized authentic audio-visual materials that were freely selected for self-study as an assignment, and their learning journals were employed for the data analyses. The results showed that a total of 115 tokens of responses were observed across all categories. The most prevalent category was ""Difficulty of Understanding Authentic Materials"" (25.2%), followed by ""Enhanced Listening Comprehension After Reading"" (15.7%), and ""Improvement in Listening Skills"" and ""Learning Content"" (12.2%, respectively). It was revealed that students highlighted significant obstacles in auditory comprehension, resulted from advanced vocabulary, specialized content, rapid speech delivery, and unfamiliar accents. In addition, students displayed a process of engaging with written scripts and vocabulary study, which enhanced listening comprehension. Improvements in listening skills, vocabulary knowledge, as well as L2 pragmatic competence were also found. Pedagogical implications drawn from these results are also discussed.",1505
2024,A Study on the Characteristics of Mass Gathering Places through Mob Psychology : Focusing on Seongsu-dong Area,"(Purpose) This study comprehensively addresses both physical and non-physical factors, emphasizing the importance of non-physical elements in preventing crowd-related incidents. The aim is to analyze the characteristics and representations of mass gathering places where crowds are formed.
(Design/methodology/approach) Previous studies have primarily focused on analyzing the physical factors of crowd accidents and the corresponding response processes. In this context, the present study emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive analysis by integrating both physical and non-physical factors in preventing crowd-related incidents. To better understand the excitement and psychological factors of large crowds, a theoretical review of crowd psychology is conducted. Furthermore, the study examines the Seongsu area, a prominent example of a mass gathering place, to identify the characteristics and representations associated with crowd formation.
(Results) Through the research process, the characteristics of crowd behavior were identified as ""impulsiveness,"" ""variability,"" ""sensitivity,"" ""simplicity,"" ""suggestibility,"" ""renewability,"" and ""intolerance."" Similarly, the characteristics of mass gathering places were derived as ""accessibility,"" ""experiential value,"" ""economic feasibility,"" and ""publicness."" An analysis of these characteristics reveals that crowd behavior and mass gathering places share a mutually reinforcing relationship, accelerating the expression of each other's traits. Mass gathering places provide optimal conditions for accommodating large groups, which facilitates the formation of crowds. These crowds, in turn, exhibit distinct crowd characteristics, thereby defining the mass gathering place. Such places, once formed, become points of interest for individuals outside the crowd, further amplifying the crowd's size. As the crowd grows, the traits of crowd behavior intensify, often manifesting in more potent and hazardous ways. Upon analyzing various cases, it is evident that preventive measures or spatial solutions addressing sudden, concentrated gatherings are insufficient. Furthermore, there is a lack of clear strategies that take into account the high excitement levels characteristic of crowd behavior. This highlights the necessity of developing improvements or alternative solutions to manage highly congested spaces effectively.",2382

(Design/methodology/approach) To analyze the cultural and artistic resources of Uijeongbu City, municipal overview and statistical data related to Uijeongbu City, data on cultural city selection, Uijeongbu Cultural Foundation, and Uijeongbu Art and Music Library were collected and categorized according to the purpose of the study. To promote Uijeongbu's local characteristics, culture, and arts to various countries, we used digital human technology to translate and then create digital humans.
(Findings) Recently, Uijeongbu City was selected as a statutory cultural city and is transforming into a city that citizens want to stay in, with a vision of a city that citizens remember and citizens who prepare for the future. Uijeongbu is well equipped with various programs and large-scale facilities to support citizens' cultural activities. The Uijeongbu Art Library and Music Library are representative spaces, and with the belief that changes in space can change the culture of libraries, change the lives of citizens, and become a driving force for regional growth, they are positioning themselves as libraries where knowledge, culture, and relaxation coexist. It has gone a step further from the role of a public library and is making new attempts to converge culture and libraries as a public platform.
(Research implications or Originality) The Uijeongbu Cultural City Support Center is conducting various cultural programs to promote the Uijeongbu Cultural City project after it was selected, and through this, it is expected to welcome an era of culture and arts where diverse cultures coexist, where artistic imagination and creativity blossom into culture, and where emotional communication is important, where youth dynamism and cultural diversity coexist. In order to create a cultural city where culture becomes life, the city is revitalizing the city by expanding various infrastructures in the cultural field and discovering and supporting cultural contents to reflect the creativity and emotional communication of various citizens. If digital human technology is well utilized to promote Uijeongbu's local cultural and artistic assets globally, it is expected that Uijeongbu City can become a center for local cultural arts where people can enjoy culture.",2528

2024,Pilot Study on the Usefulness of Quantitative Light-Induced Fluorescence-Digital for Dental Plaque Assessment in a Rat Model of Periodontitis,"Objective: This study quantifies dental plaque in an animal periodontitis model using quantitative light-induced fluorescence-digital (QLF-D), providing fundamental data for establishing diagnostic criteria for periodontitis. Methods: Periodontitis was induced by ligating the mandibular first molars of Sprague–Dawley rats. After 18 days, QLF-D images showing the plaque on the ligatures were obtained intraorally before sacrifice and extraorally after sacrifice. The red and blue fluorescence values were measured using software, and the average red/blue (R/B) ratio was calculated for each image. Alveolar bone loss was evaluated histologically. Results: Ligation of the first molars resulted in an increase in the periodontal ligament area compared to that of the control group, demonstrating alveolar bone resorption. The extraoral lingual-side images obtained after sacrifice were reproducible and provided clear assessment criteria. The R/B ratio of the plaque accumulated on the ligatures was 1.9±0.3. Conclusions: Plaque formation, which is difficult to assess by visual inspection alone, can be evaluated using QLF-D. The animal model of periodontitis used in this study can be used to obtain preclinical data to develop future preventive and therapeutic strategies for periodontal diseases.",1301

2024,Pursuing the Idea of World-Class Universities in Korea: Faculty and Administrator Perspectives,"[Purpose] Recognizing the significant role of higher education in today's knowledge economy, many countries have aggressively participated in building world-class universities. The purpose of this study is to understand how local actors, namely faculty and administrators, made sense of and defined the idea and pursuit of WCUs in the context of non-Western countries, Korea. We used the concept of glonacal heuristic to consider three dimensions of higher education activities—global, national, and local (Marginson & Rhoades, 2002) in Korean higher education.
[Methods] We conducted interviews with 22 faculty and university administrators from three top universities in Korea.
[Results] Findings showed that faculty and administrators defined the WCU idea differently, despite drawing upon the same sources of global ideas, national policy context, and local matters. Their definition either emphasized the global and national or were rather mediated by the local. We also found tensions between faculty in STEM fields and those in non-STEM fields, in conforming to the WCU efforts.
[Conclusion] Based on these findings, we discussed theoretical and practical implications.",1176
2024,Financial Development and Economic Growth in Nepal: Empirical Evidence from a Liberalized Developing Economy,"This study analyzes the relationship between financial development and economic growth in Nepal using annual time series data from 1985 to 2016. The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bound test approach estimated the cointegration form and long-run relationship. The results indicate that Nepal’s financial development and economic growth are cointegrated with bi-directional causality in the long-run, which suggests that they positively and significantly impact each other. The causal effects from financial development to economic growth are more potent than from economic growth to financial development. However, the speed of adjustment towards long-run equilibrium, directing from economic growth to financial development, is robust. There is a one-directional reverse causality from economic growth to financial development in the short-run. Based on these results, the study recommends that policymakers prioritize developing a well-functioning and effective financial sector to enhance economic growth, particularly in developing countries such as Nepal.",1067

2024,A Sociolinguistic Study of the Retroflex Variant of the Korean Liquid Phoneme,"A retroflex approximant has recently been identified as a variant of the liquid in Standard Korean (Hwang et al., 2019). This article examines said variant primarily among speakers from Central and Gyeongsangdo Korean dialects in several syllabic and vocalic contexts. It utilizes data classified using an auditory methodology from two tasks with 13 speakers from Central dialect areas, 8 from Gyeongsangdo, and 2 from Jeollado to show that the retroflex variant is more common among men and speakers from Gyeongsangdo than women and speakers from Central dialect regions respectively. It further shows that it is women from the Gyeongsangdo that show stylistic variation in the usage of the retroflex suggesting that is acquiring the status of a sociolinguistic marker. Finally, the article shows that the retroflex variant is most likely to occur at the end of a word, before /h/, and after non-high vowels, back vowels, and rounded vowels.",942

2024,Research on Urban Regeneration Projects using Crowdfunding: Focusing on the British Case,"The development of the ICT (Information Communication Technology) industry, which has driven the Fourth Industrial Revolution, promotes the digitalization of network products. Additionally, new business models are continuously being created through convergence with e-commerce.
Crowdfunding is an opportunity and means for business owners to promote their business to an unspecified number of people and secure funds. Unlike investment funds that are generally concentrated in businesses with a high probability of success, in crowdfunding, funds can only be secured when a consensus is formed about the business. Even in urban regeneration projects, crowdfunding is an effective way for business operators to publicize the project to an unspecified number of people and raise funds.
In Korea, urban decline continues due to low birth rate and aging due to changes in business structure, increase in depopulated areas, and changes in social and economic conditions. In this situation, this study explores urban regeneration projects and crowdfunding to find ways to revitalize sustainable local communities in which various entities participate.
This study aims to analyze the characteristics of crowdfunding, which are differentiated from traditional financing methods, the meaning of urban regeneration projects, and cases of overseas developed countries. Additionally, this study seeks to suggest ways to utilize crowdfunding in urban regeneration policy and its implications.",1479
2024,A Study on Feasibility of Office-to-Residential Conversion for Urban Regeneration in the Downtown Areas,"(Background and Purpose) After rapid industrialization, South Korea faced urban development challenges such as population concentration in major cities, urban vacancy in downtown areas, and a decrease in population and industrial diversity. It is a critical time to address these urban issues and restore urban functions through socially, environmentally, culturally, and economically integrated strategies. Therefore, urban structural reorganization, infrastructure enhancement, and strategies for sustainable development goals are imperative. This paper aims to define the scope of sustainability through the adaptive reuse of surplus office spaces into residential areas, with the goal of continuously increasing urban diversity to restore and revitalize the competitiveness of declining urban cores. (Method) In terms of research methodology, we plan to initially conduct a 'Diagnosis of urban decline' in the six major cities in Korea, utilizing the 'Urban Revitalization Plan' of the 'Evaluation System for Feasibility of Urban Regeneration New Deal Project' as the basis for analysis. Subsequently, we will proceed to investigate urban assets and derive 'Derivation of current urban issues', followed by proposing methods for 'Discovering customized sustainable contents' to address local problems. (Results) The natural vacancy rate for office spaces in urban areas of the six major cities in Korea was estimated to be between 6% and 8% based on the nationwide urban asset survey conducted in 2023. Applying this to business facility areas, the study calculated the expected area of vacant office spaces, revealing a significant problem of space wastage in the downtown areas of the six major cities in Korea. Converting surplus office spaces into residential units to address these local issues offers several benefits. Firstly, it can contribute to urban regeneration strategies, environmental improvement, and sustainable development of the local community. Secondly, it provides an opportunity for urban regeneration without the need for additional land acquisition or massive construction costs, thus enabling the use of tailored sustainable content. Thirdly, by addressing the mutual issues of increasing office vacancies and declining residential populations in urban areas, it can lead to not only urban regeneration but also economic revitalization and improvement in quality of life. (Conclusions) The downtown areas of major cities in Korea, while symbolizing their history and functions, are facing challenges of decline due to uneven development. Rising land and housing prices exacerbate this decline, making it crucial to emphasize new strategies that prioritize residential expansion and sustainability to revitalize these areas. Therefore, converting surplus office space into residential units can provide a feasible solution by promoting adaptive reuse of urban assets for sustainable residential development. This method effectively addresses the increasing office vacancy rates, revitalizes downtown areas, enhances settlement conditions, restores community ties, and is expected to improve urban resilience and prevent urban decay.",3161
2024,A Convergence Study of Influencing Factors on Learning Stickiness among College Students in Online Dance Courses,"The emergence of online education has notably reshaped dance arts education, presenting new challenges and opportunities for student engagement.
This study delves into the specific motivations of college students enrolled in online dance courses and examines how these motivations influence learning stickiness—a key determinant of sustained engagement and success in online learning environments. While online dance education is gaining traction for its accessibility and flexibility, there is a scarcity of research focusing on the intricate relationship between student motivations and their propensity to persist in these courses, known as learning stickiness. Our study addresses this gap by identifying and analyzing critical factors that drive college students' participation in online dance courses and their subsequent effect on learning stickiness. Our findings reveal more nuanced insights into the dynamics of online learning. Knowledge content quality and platform service quality emerged as pivotal elements, significantly elevating students' perceived usefulness and enjoyment of the courses. These elements also played a crucial role in mitigating perceived fees and risks associated with online learning. We found that perceived usefulness directly contributes to an increase in perceived value. However, the influence of perceived enjoyment on perceived value, while present, was not as pronounced. Intriguingly, both perceived enjoyment and perceived risk were found to have a negative correlation with perceived value.
Most notably, our data underscored that perceived value is a potent enhancer of learning stickiness among college students. These findings offer more than just a surface understanding of student motivations in online dance education; they unearth specific interactions between various motivational factors and their collective impact on learning stickiness. Our study not only adds depth to the understanding of online dance education dynamics but also provides actionable insights for course designers and educators in refining content and platform services. By highlighting these unique patterns and insights, this research contributes substantially to enhancing the quality and effectiveness of online dance education and, by extension, the broader domain of online arts education.",2323
2024,Research on Syllabic Features of Proper Nouns Based on the Spoken Korean Corpus,"This study focuses on the recognition of out-of-vocabulary words, particularly emphasizing the recognition of proper nouns, which has a significant impact on Korean natural language information processing. Based on a large Korean spoken language corpus created by the researcher, the study focuses on four key positions in computer segmentation: the initial and final syllables of word segments containing proper nouns, and their collocations with the preceding and succeeding word segments. Through comparative analysis with word segments that do not contain proper nouns, the research investigates the syllabic features of proper noun segments from both statistical and linguistic perspectives. Statistically, the study uses independence tests to confirm a significant correlation between syllable usage patterns at these positions and the presence of proper nouns, providing empirical support for the study. Additionally, linguistic analysis delves into the specific reasons for the correlation, offering valuable linguistic insights for word segmentation containing proper noun word segments.",1096

2024,Eine Studie über den Ursprung und die Entwicklung der Abendmahlsüberlieferung,"Eine Studie über den Ursprung und die Entwicklung der Abendmahlsüberlieferung: Im Fokus der synoptischen Evangelien und Paulusbriefe.
Die Abendmahlstradition bildet eine Brücke zwischen der paulinischen Tradition und den synoptischen Evangelien, wirft aber auch die Frage auf, woher Paulus diese Tradition hat. Insbesondere scheint die Abendmahlserzählung eine besondere Beziehung zur lukanisch-paulinischen und zur Markus-Matthäus-Erzählung zu haben.
Die vorliegende Studie wird diese Verbindungen untersuchen und versuchen, ihre Ursprünge durch textliche, mündliche, literarische und stilgeschichtliche Untersuchungen nachzuvollziehen. Es gibt mehrereMöglichkeiten: erstens den Vorrang der paulinischen Tradition. Da die Paulusbriefe älter sind als die synoptischen Evangelien, könnte das Material in 1 Korinther die ursprüngliche Abendmahlsüberlieferung sein. Zweitens, der Vorrang der synoptischen Evangelien. Dies geht von der Annahme aus, dass Markus oder Matthäus eine ältere Überlieferung verwendet haben. Drittens besteht die Möglichkeit der Existenz einer gemeinsamen Quelle (PS-Q), die von Markus, Matthäus und Paulus verwendet wurde. Mit Blick auf Lukas ist es auch möglich, dass er sowohl die synoptischen als auch die paulinischen Quellen verwendet.
Diese Studie versucht, unser Verständnis der Ursprünge und der Entwicklung der Abendmahlstradition zu erweitern, indem sie sich auf diese Möglichkeiten konzentriert.",1429
2024,A Study of the Relationship Between Oral Health and Stress and Depression in College Students in Selected Regions,"This study examined the association of subjective oral health and oral health behaviors with stress, and depression in college students in selected regions. In terms of stress and depression according to general characteristics of college students, stress was significantly different in the group living alone, and both stress and depression were significantly different in the group with low income and low life satisfaction (p<0.05). Stress by subjective oral health status was significantly different in the groups with dental caries, masticatory discomfort, halitosis, interdental food impaction, dyspepsia, temporomandibular joint(TMJ) pain, tooth hypersensitivity, and dry mouth (p<0.05). Stress related to oral health behaviors was significantly different among those who brushed twice or less, did not use oral care products, had not visited a dental within the past year and drank alcohol (p<0.05). Among the factors influencing stress, life satisfaction had the highest impact, followed by living type, tooth hypersensitivity, dyspepsia and dental caries, and among the factors influencing depression, dyspepsia had the highest impact, followed by dyspepsia and life satisfaction(p<0.001). In order to alleviate the stress and depression felt by students, it is necessary to develop and implement systematic programs in colleges, and various oral health education and programs should be developed to improve the oral health of college students.",1454
2024,An Exploratory Research on the Perceptions and Attitudes of Chinese University Students Towards Artificial Intelligence (AI) Education as Liberal Arts Courses,"In the Fourth Industrial Revolution era, awareness of artificial intelligence and the ability to apply it within one's field are essential skills for university students majoring in computer-related fields and non-majors. The Chinese Ministry of Education has emphasized the ""Artificial Intelligence + N"" education model, initiating AI education as a liberal arts subject for non-majors in Chinese universities. Consequently, when designing AI courses for non-majors, it is crucial to thoroughly understand the AI learning experiences, perceptions, and attitudes of a diverse student population. This study aims to investigate the perceptions of AI learning experiences and attitudes towards AI education among non-majors at a Chinese university to inform the future direction of AI education as a liberal arts subject. To achieve this, a survey was conducted in the first semester of 2023, targeting 607 non-major students at S University in China. The study yielded the following results: First, most Chinese university students hold very positive perceptions of AI education and strongly believe in the necessity of AI education for non-majors. Second, statistically significant differences in perceptions and attitudes towards AI were observed based on whether students had prior AI learning experiences. Students with AI learning experiences before entering university had more positive perceptions of AI than those without such experiences. These findings suggest potential directions for AI education as a liberal arts subject in Chinese universities and provide valuable insights for designing AI courses tailored to non-majors.",1636
2024,A Comparative Analysis of International and Domestic New Ventures: Focusing on Board and Firm Characteristics,"This study examines key differences in board and firm characteristics between international new ventures (INVs) and domestic new ventures (DNVs), focusing on how these factors shape the distinctive features of INVs. By analyzing multiple dimensions, including board human and social capital as well as firm operational and financial attributes, this study provides a comprehensive view of factors influencing ventures' pathways to early and rapid internationalization. Based on the Korean ventures listed on the KOSDAQ from 2011 to 2020, this study reveals that board members' international background and financial ties facilitate early international expansion. Additionally, firms with low marketing investments, asset-light operations, and high activity levels strategically position themselves for early internationalization, especially under restrictive domestic financial conditions. This study underscores the importance of specific board and firm resources in becoming INVs, highlighting the strategic value of board composition and financial metrics in driving global growth.",1084
2024,Factors Driving States’ Economic Growth in the United States: Social Contagion and a Punctuated Equilibrium Perspective,"(Purpose) This study empirically examines factors in states’ economic growth with emphases on agenda setting and decision making across U.S. states over a 41-year period (1980–2020).
(Design/methodology/approach) The two-step system generalized method of moments (GMM) was used to analyze overall economic growth.
(Findings) States considered neighboring states’ policy processes and responded to these circumstances rather than their own policy processes. Elected officials had less policy priority for economic development, whereas a gubernatorial election year produced incremental economic growth. Balanced budget rules prevented drastic economic downturns; tax and expenditure limitations promoted incremental economic growth. All state partisan compositions led to rapid economic decline, which Democrats sought to manage. States with more conservative citizens witnessed overall economic growth along with positive and general punctuation. An initiative process fostered economic growth through these two forms of punctuation as well, while political institutions contributed to negative punctuation.
(Research implications or Originality) It expands on features related to states’ economic growth through the lenses of social contagion, social learning theory, and PET. The results offer practitioners valuable insight into the mechanisms behind such growth.",1366
2024,A Study on Cultural Product Design Preferences in the Guangxi Region Based on Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions,"This study began by exploring the importance of local culture in the context of globalization and local cultural integration. The purpose of this study is to explore cultural product design preferences in Guangxi and to open up new perspectives for its cultural product development and industrial development. Therefore, this paper analyzes product design preferences in the cultural dimension through Hofstede's theory of cultural dimensions and literature studies and constructs a product design model in the cultural dimension. The model reveals Guangxi's cultural product design preferences for the ""2021 China Top 100"" cultural products. Finally, an attempt was made to develop a scale for internal regions of China to test and confirm the design preferences of Guangxi cultural products, and the results are as follows: First, Guangxi cultural product designs tend to display large and prominent patterns. Second, there is a preference for complex and diversified design series. Third, the preference for sharp colors and hard line designs. Fourth, design is highly concerned with safety. Fifth, pay more attention to quality. Sixth, pay more attention to the design of the service. Based on these findings, it is recommended that when developing and designing Guangxi products, such as artwork, decorative paintings, and clothing, symbolic elements should be amplified and highlighted, and bright contrasting colors and hard lines should be used to appeal to the eye, as well as retaining cultural and aesthetic preferences. For children's toys and outdoor products, diversified ranges of products should be developed, and emphasis should be placed on safe materials and safety designs.

2024,算法推荐下网络服务平台著作权侵权责任的认定,随着互联网自媒体时代的到来，大部分网络服务平台为了增加用户粘性，赚取商业利益，引入了算法推荐技术。针对此种情境下衍生的著作权侵权问题，法律及实践中均未形成统一的认定标准，对于算法推荐下的著作权侵权责任认定问题的探讨具有一定的意义。算法推荐环境下，网络服务平台的著作权侵权责任认定仍存在诸多问题，如算法推荐行为本身所面临的中立性理论难题；算法推荐下网络服务平台履行注意义务的界定标准模糊、层次混乱；算法推荐下传统“通知-删除”规则的局限性问题等。受到美国、欧盟等地区互联网著作权侵权中事前过滤机制的启发，对于算法推荐环境下，网络服务平台的著作权侵权责任认定问题，首先应当突破算法推荐中立性的障碍，坚持算法推荐具有伪中立性；其次应当引入事前过滤机制以提升网络服务平台的注意义务；最后应当通过界定清晰的审查义务及必要措施标准，进而完善传统“通知-删除”规则，同时国家也应进一步加强对于算法的规制，推进算法透明化。,403
2024,中国共同抵押权实现规则研究 －以调整当事人的利益为中心－,"중국에서 공동저당권의 주요 목적은 다수의 저당물을 공동저당물로 하여 채권의 안정성과 실현가능성을 확보하는 것이다. 이와 관련해 중국 민법은 공동저당권을 실행함에 있어 당사자의 사적자치를 존중한다. 동시에, 여러 당사자의 이익을 합리적으로 조정하고 채권의 공평한 실현을 추구한다. 이와 관련해 본 연구는 중국 공동저당권 실행원칙에 대해 당사자의 이익조정을 중심으로 연구하였다. 특히, 공동저당권자의 선택권 행사의 제한과 공동저당권 행사과정에서의 배당액 확정을 중심으로 살펴보았다.
구체적으로는 먼저 공동저당권의 성질 및 입법 모델을 살펴보았다. 특히, 입법 모델과 관련하여 자유선택권보장주의와 제한주의, 분배주의와 분할주의, 조정주의와 비조정주의 등을 분석하였다. 다음으로 공동저당권자가 채권을 실현함에 있어 중요한 권리인 공동저당권자의 자유선택권에 대해 다루었다. 이어서 공동저당권자가 채권을 실현하는 상황을 공동저당물 전부가 채무자에게 속하는 경우, 공동저당물이 채무자 및 물상보증인에게 속하는 경우, 공동저당물 전부가 물상보증인에게 속하는 경우 등으로 구분하여 각각 고찰하였다.
위와 같은 연구를 통해 본 논문은 다음과 같은 주요 논지를 제시하였다.
우선, 공동저당권자가 저당권을 실행함에 있어서는 그 권리행사에 일정한 제한이 요구된다. 특히, 공동저당권자의 선택권에 대한 제한이 필요하다. 이는 채무자, 물상보증인 및 후순위 저당권자의 이익을 보호하는 데 기여할 수 있다. 공동저당권자의 선택권에 대한 제한은 세부적으로 두 가지 점에서 구현되어야 한다. 첫째, 채무자가 저당목적물을 제공한 경우 채권자의 선택권은 채무자의 이익에 따른 합리적인 제한을 받아야 한다. 둘째, 물상보증인이 저당목적물을 제공한 경우 채권자의 선택권은 물상보증인의 이익을 고려하여 행사되어야 한다.
또한, 채권자의 선택권을 존중하면서도 채무자, 물상보증인 및 후순위저당권자의 이익도 도모해야 한다. 공동저당의 실행과정에서는 저당목적물의 배당액을 확정해야 하는데, 이 때 저당목적물의 배당액은 저당목적물의 가치를 고려해야 할뿐만 아니라 채권의 성질과 당사자의 약정을 고려하여 배당의 공평을 도모해야 한다. 이와 관련해 동시배당과 이시배당의 경우, 변제자대위와 후순위저당권자의 대위제도를 이용하여 이해관계를 조정할 수 있다.
이상과 같이 채권자의 선택권에 대한 제한 및 채권자의 실행선택권을 존중하면서도 채무자･물상보증인･후순위저당권자의 이익을 보호하는 것은 공동저당제도의 취지를 살리고, 그 기능의 충실한 이행을 확보하는 데 기여할 수 있을 것이다.",1247
2024,A Study on the Development of a Hotel Economic Trend Predictive Model Using Machine Learning Models,"(Purpose) Based on a total of 21 hotel economic trend data collected through the Korea Statistical Information Service (KOSIS) and the Korea Hotel Industry Association, this study uses a machine learning model to determine the prediction model estimation and the importance of variables to propose a differentiation strategy for hotels to preemptively respond to rapidly changing economic fluctuations.
(Design/methodology/approach) Based on previous research, a machine learning model was used to grasp the prediction accuracy and importance of variables in the hotel economic trend model. Data collection was based on a total of 12 years of data from 2011 to 2022, and the data cycle was set on a monthly and quarterly basis. On the other hand, the orange data mining 3.32 program, a machine learning program, was used to grasp the prediction accuracy of hotel business trends.
(Findings) The prediction accuracy was the highest in the linear form at 93.3%, followed by the neural network at 89.7%, linear at 83.3%, and support vector machine at 75.6%. In other words, it is judged that it is necessary to actively use adaboost and neural network models to predict hotel business trends and future time series models.
(Research implications or Originality) In order to predict hotel economic trends, in addition to existing macroeconomic indicators, room profit rate indicators, which directly affect hotel revenue, should be considered. Implications of this study provide academic and managerial suggestions and limitations of the study and directions for future research are suggested.",1589
2024,Study on the Structural Safety of Hybrid Wheelsets Using Flexible Multibody Dynamics Analysis,"In this study, to evaluate the structural safety of hybrid wheelsets with both of non-IRW and IRW, the structural analysis and flexible multibody dynamic (FMBD) analysis was conducted. Especially, in the case of hybrid axle controlled by gearbox, the safety of the gears in the gearbox and installed on the axle should be verified. In addition, the hybrid axle must satisfy railroad vehicle safety regulations. Therefore, based on the acceleration conditions of standard type Korea electric multiple unit (K-EMU), the loads of the contact part were evaluated through the FMBD analysis for the gears, and the structural analysis for them was performed using the loads of the contact part. In the case of the axle, structural analysis was performed based on the structural safety evaluation standard (EN 13103) for railway vehicle axles to evaluate structural safety. From the analysis, the maximum Von-Mises stress of the gears was below the yield strength of the applied material, and the hybrid axle met the safety standard.",1025

The proposed model achieved up to 95% vehicle parts detection accuracy, an improvement of 3% over that of the existing model, and a damage classification accuracy of 89%, an improvement of 6% over that of the existing model. With the recent rapid development of computer vision and deep learning technology, vehicle parts detection and damage classification are expected to provide new scientific method for vehicle repair.",935
2024,A study on the impact of workplace spirituality on unethical pro-organizational behavior,"This study aims to examine the relationship between workplace spirituality (WPS) and unethical pro-organizational behavior (UPB), as well as explore the mediating role of moral disengagement (MD) in this relationship. Using a sample of 266 employees working in China, hypotheses were tested through a structural equation model. The results indicate a positive correlation between WPS and UPB, with MD not exhibiting a mediating effect in the relationship between WPS and UPB. Further analysis of the relationship between the three dimensions of WPS and UPB reveals that meaningful work and values consistent with the organization have a direct impact on UPB. However, community consciousness requires MD to generate UPB, indicating a complete mediating effect of MD in the relationship between community consciousness and UPB. Based on these findings, potential threats posed by WPS are identified, providing theoretical guidance for future research on WPS.",957
2024,The Research of Trend Comparison on Corporate Ethics of Korean Companies: Focused on the Perceptions of the Employees,"The past 20 years have been when Korean companies have emphasized the importance of corporate ethics and transparent management. Before the 21st century, Korean companies experienced the IMF economic crisis due to non-transparent business operations and governance issues. Since then, Korean companies have set corporate ethics as an essential task in business operations and ostensibly emphasized it. However, many questions have also been raised about whether these corporate ethics activities go beyond documentation and exist as a core competency to improve corporate performance. In addition, comparative studies were insufficient for studies related to corporate ethics. Many studies investigated based on a specific point in time and presented the results. In order to overcome the shortcomings of these studies, this study conducted a trend analysis based on surveys from two different points in time. Significant issues of corporate ethics were presented, and employee perception (centered on middle managers) was investigated. The time of the study was 2005 and 2015, and the trends in orporate ethics perception over the past ten years were compared.
The core results of the study are as follows. First, about corporate ethics, CSR's target emphasizes customers, indicating that it is shifting from shareholder-oriented management to customer- and employee-oriented management. Second, although the ostensible institutionalization of the ethical management system related to corporate ethics is being improved, there is still a conflict of ethical decision-making. In addition, major ethical conflict issues focus on the issue of fairness and discrimination. Third, as a significant way to increase ethical value within a company, it should be possible to present general ethical codes to members and apply them as management practices. Fourth, harmful bribery or unfairness in the past is relatively reduced. Fourth, while trust in the company increases, the government, politics, and greedy competition see the problem negatively. These findings are a comparison between 2005 and 2015, and it is necessary to conduct additional related studies in 2025 to understand how this ethical perception changes.",2215
2024,Research on Promoting Uijeongbu's Regional Characteristics and Cultural Arts Resources Using Digital Human Technology,"(Purpose) This study investigated the use of digital human technology as a way to not only preserve Uijeongbu's local culture and arts, but also to publicize the characteristics of the region and share the unique culture and arts of the region globally.
(Design/methodology/approach) To analyze the cultural and artistic resources of Uijeongbu City, municipal overview and statistical data related to Uijeongbu City, data on cultural city selection, Uijeongbu Cultural Foundation, and Uijeongbu Art and Music Library were collected and categorized according to the purpose of the study. To promote Uijeongbu's local characteristics, culture, and arts to various countries, we used digital human technology to translate and then create digital humans.
(Findings) Recently, Uijeongbu City was selected as a statutory cultural city and is transforming into a city that citizens want to stay in, with a vision of a city that citizens remember and citizens who prepare for the future. Uijeongbu is well equipped with various programs and large-scale facilities to support citizens' cultural activities. The Uijeongbu Art Library and Music Library are representative spaces, and with the belief that changes in space can change the culture of libraries, change the lives of citizens, and become a driving force for regional growth, they are positioning themselves as libraries where knowledge, culture, and relaxation coexist. It has gone a step further from the role of a public library and is making new attempts to converge culture and libraries as a public platform.
(Research implications or Originality) The Uijeongbu Cultural City Support Center is conducting various cultural programs to promote the Uijeongbu Cultural City project after it was selected, and through this, it is expected to welcome an era of culture and arts where diverse cultures coexist, where artistic imagination and creativity blossom into culture, and where emotional communication is important, where youth dynamism and cultural diversity coexist. In order to create a cultural city where culture becomes life, the city is revitalizing the city by expanding various infrastructures in the cultural field and discovering and supporting cultural contents to reflect the creativity and emotional communication of various citizens. If digital human technology is well utilized to promote Uijeongbu's local cultural and artistic assets globally, it is expected that Uijeongbu City can become a center for local cultural arts where people can enjoy culture.",2528
2024,A Study on the Location Error Reduction Method of GPS-based Augmented Reality App. - A Research Focused on Miracle Game -,"This paper investigates the incremental “distance difference” between the point on a display where an object should be created to where it is actually created on GPS-based AR (Augmented Reality) apps. This virtual gap, however small, is an issue for accuracy and user satisfaction. To correct this inaccuracy, a reduction method is offered here to reduce it. To this end, the researcher has developed a prototype AR game called “Miracle” to simulate adjustment differences through the basic game premise where the user saves cartoon ducks through location hunting. The impetus, therefore, for developing this game takes a different anaytical direction compared to other analyses of the social, cultural or political elements found in the popular AR mobile game “Pokemon Go” developed in 2016. By focusing specifically on GPS and topographical methods, this article will elaborate and offer solutions to spatial, programming, and technological glitches that made game play difficult on “Pokemon Go.” To enable this outcome, a series of tests were administered by the author through their amateur build “Miracle” game. After several tests were concluded the results offer several solutions through an error reduction method.",1222
2024,Anti-inflammatory and nitrite scavenging activities using Camellia assamica root extract,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and nitrite scavenging activities using various extracts of Camellia assamica root. There are no cytotoxicity at 100μg/mL of extracts except for hexane extract. Inhibitory production of inducible nitric oxide synthase increased with increasing concentration regardless of extract. In particular, when methanol and hot water extract concentration increased from 50μg/mL to 100μg/mL, they were increased from 14.4% to 34.2% and 11.9% to 30.7%, respectively. TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 expressions showed the best production inhibition effect in methanol and hot water extracts. In particular, the methanol extract showed a 33.6%, 23.5% and 26.7%, respectively. In the case of hot water extract, they showed 30.2%, 22.2%, and 25.4%, respectively. The nitrite scavenging activity was the highest as 65.3% in methanol extract. Ammonium oxidation using the water extract had a high value of 26.7 mg/ kg. In the case of nitrite oxidation, it was 25.8 mg/kg in the water extract. These results indicated that Camellia assamica root extracts may be a potential anti-inflammatory therapeutic agent due to the significant effects on inflammatory activities.",1207
2024,A Study on the Characteristics of Mass Gathering Places through Mob Psychology : Focusing on Seongsu-dong Area,"(Purpose) This study comprehensively addresses both physical and non-physical factors, emphasizing the importance of non-physical elements in preventing crowd-related incidents. The aim is to analyze the characteristics and representations of mass gathering places where crowds are formed.
(Design/methodology/approach) Previous studies have primarily focused on analyzing the physical factors of crowd accidents and the corresponding response processes. In this context, the present study emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive analysis by integrating both physical and non-physical factors in preventing crowd-related incidents. To better understand the excitement and psychological factors of large crowds, a theoretical review of crowd psychology is conducted. Furthermore, the study examines the Seongsu area, a prominent example of a mass gathering place, to identify the characteristics and representations associated with crowd formation.
(Results) Through the research process, the characteristics of crowd behavior were identified as ""impulsiveness,"" ""variability,"" ""sensitivity,"" ""simplicity,"" ""suggestibility,"" ""renewability,"" and ""intolerance."" Similarly, the characteristics of mass gathering places were derived as ""accessibility,"" ""experiential value,"" ""economic feasibility,"" and ""publicness."" An analysis of these characteristics reveals that crowd behavior and mass gathering places share a mutually reinforcing relationship, accelerating the expression of each other's traits. Mass gathering places provide optimal conditions for accommodating large groups, which facilitates the formation of crowds. These crowds, in turn, exhibit distinct crowd characteristics, thereby defining the mass gathering place. Such places, once formed, become points of interest for individuals outside the crowd, further amplifying the crowd's size. As the crowd grows, the traits of crowd behavior intensify, often manifesting in more potent and hazardous ways. Upon analyzing various cases, it is evident that preventive measures or spatial solutions addressing sudden, concentrated gatherings are insufficient. Furthermore, there is a lack of clear strategies that take into account the high excitement levels characteristic of crowd behavior. This highlights the necessity of developing improvements or alternative solutions to manage highly congested spaces effectively.",2382
2024,An Exploratory Study on University Students’ Perceptions Toward English Learning Through Using Authentic Audio-Visual Materials,"The advantages of the use of authentic materials are well established in the foreign language classroom. The present study aims to examine Korean university students' perceptions of authentic audio-video materials in language learning. It explores how students view these materials' impact on their language acquisition and related skill development. 49 participants for this study were students from a local university in Korea, indicating an intermediate language proficiency level. They utilized authentic audio-visual materials that were freely selected for self-study as an assignment, and their learning journals were employed for the data analyses. The results showed that a total of 115 tokens of responses were observed across all categories. The most prevalent category was ""Difficulty of Understanding Authentic Materials"" (25.2%), followed by ""Enhanced Listening Comprehension After Reading"" (15.7%), and ""Improvement in Listening Skills"" and ""Learning Content"" (12.2%, respectively). It was revealed that students highlighted significant obstacles in auditory comprehension, resulted from advanced vocabulary, specialized content, rapid speech delivery, and unfamiliar accents. In addition, students displayed a process of engaging with written scripts and vocabulary study, which enhanced listening comprehension. Improvements in listening skills, vocabulary knowledge, as well as L2 pragmatic competence were also found. Pedagogical implications drawn from these results are also discussed.",1505
2024,Pilot Study on the Usefulness of Quantitative Light-Induced Fluorescence-Digital for Dental Plaque Assessment in a Rat Model of Periodontitis,"Objective: This study quantifies dental plaque in an animal periodontitis model using quantitative light-induced fluorescence-digital (QLF-D), providing fundamental data for establishing diagnostic criteria for periodontitis. Methods: Periodontitis was induced by ligating the mandibular first molars of Sprague–Dawley rats. After 18 days, QLF-D images showing the plaque on the ligatures were obtained intraorally before sacrifice and extraorally after sacrifice. The red and blue fluorescence values were measured using software, and the average red/blue (R/B) ratio was calculated for each image. Alveolar bone loss was evaluated histologically. Results: Ligation of the first molars resulted in an increase in the periodontal ligament area compared to that of the control group, demonstrating alveolar bone resorption. The extraoral lingual-side images obtained after sacrifice were reproducible and provided clear assessment criteria. The R/B ratio of the plaque accumulated on the ligatures was 1.9±0.3. Conclusions: Plaque formation, which is difficult to assess by visual inspection alone, can be evaluated using QLF-D. The animal model of periodontitis used in this study can be used to obtain preclinical data to develop future preventive and therapeutic strategies for periodontal diseases.",1301

2024,Study on the Effects of Operating Diametral Clearance Change on the Characteristics of Angular Contact Ball Bearings,"This study investigates the influence of operating diametral clearance on the performance of angular contact ball bearings(ACBBs). It examines critical factors affecting diametral clearance, including mounting conditions, external loads,temperature fluctuations, and rotational speeds. A novel model combining quasi-static and fit-up approaches is proposed toanalyze the effects of operating diametral clearances on ACBB performance. This model incorporates key elements suchas ball-race contact loads, interactions between the shaft and inner ring, interference fits between the housing and outerring, centrifugal expansion of the rotating shaft and inner ring, and temperature-induced changes. Internal clearancevariations are computed using the thick-ring theory. Simulations are conducted to predict ACBB characteristics undervarious fit-up conditions, including contact load distribution and stiffness, with results validated using commercial software.
The study also explores the impact of various operating diametral clearances on ACBB performance under differing fittingconditions, external loads, and rotational speeds.",1128

2024,Pursuing the Idea of World-Class Universities in Korea: Faculty and Administrator Perspectives,"[Purpose] Recognizing the significant role of higher education in today's knowledge economy, many countries have aggressively participated in building world-class universities. The purpose of this study is to understand how local actors, namely faculty and administrators, made sense of and defined the idea and pursuit of WCUs in the context of non-Western countries, Korea. We used the concept of glonacal heuristic to consider three dimensions of higher education activities—global, national, and local (Marginson & Rhoades, 2002) in Korean higher education.
[Methods] We conducted interviews with 22 faculty and university administrators from three top universities in Korea.
[Results] Findings showed that faculty and administrators defined the WCU idea differently, despite drawing upon the same sources of global ideas, national policy context, and local matters. Their definition either emphasized the global and national or were rather mediated by the local. We also found tensions between faculty in STEM fields and those in non-STEM fields, in conforming to the WCU efforts.
[Conclusion] Based on these findings, we discussed theoretical and practical implications.",1176
2024,A Study on the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Creative Convergence Problem Solving,"The objective of this study is to examine the factors that shape problem-solving processes through the lens of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and to develop an educational model that integrates generative AI into the problem-solving process. To facilitate analysis, we divided the problem-solving process into three stages: understanding the problem, designing the solution, and selecting the best solution. Subsequently, we aligned each stage with the nine core elements of computational thinking to develop the educational framework. Following the development of a generative AI-based software engineering course based on the design, a correlation analysis was conducted on the necessity of generative AI in the problem-solving process. This analysis was performed after providing 218 learners of humanities and social sciences with a 16-week basic software engineering education. The results of the hierarchical regression analysis demonstrated that generative AI exerted an influence when data were analyzed during the problem understanding stage (t-value = 8.85, R Square = 0.712). In the design stage of the problem-solving process, generative AI had a significant impact on the algorithms and procedures step (t-value = 13.810, R Square = 0.713). In the selection of the optimal solution, generative AI was found to exert a considerable influence in the automation stage (t-value = 7.764, R Square = 0.691). In light of these findings, it was concluded that the integration of generative AI into the stages of data analysis, algorithms and procedures, and automation in the educational curriculum could enhance learners' problem-solving abilities. It is our contention that this research will facilitate future research on learning guidelines for generative AI.",1777
2024,Enhancing the Relationship Performance of Supply Chain Participants - Perspective of Interactional Justice -,"Given the dynamic reorganization observed in erstwhile supply chains, many scholars are developing optimal methods to efficiently operate supply chains. Against this background, this study assumed that the relationships of supply chain participants were a key element of supply chain performance and explored paths for relationship optimization. For the empirical analysis, a survey was conducted with employees working in supply chain-related jobs in South Korea. A total of 350 questionnaires were included in the analysis, and a structural equation model was used for hypothesis testing. The two dimensions of interactional justice, namely interpersonal justice and informational justice, were found to have a significant positive impact on the factors of the triangular theory of love. Hence, perceiving justice when transacting with counterparts within the supply chain is vital for enhancing levels of intimacy, passion, and commitment. While passion and commitment showed a significant positive influence on relationship performance, intimacy did not. These results reflect the current supply chain environment, indicating that an appropriate level of passion and commitment is necessary for members constructing a supply chain. This study demonstrates that behavioral science factors commonly observed in interpersonal relationships can also be explored in business relationships, thus highlighting its interdisciplinary relevance. The results have practical implications for companies considering supply chain relational dynamics.",1539
2024,The Hallyu and K-pop Fandoms in France : A Phenomenological Study of Transnational Locality,"This paper is a study of French K-pop fandom and aims to examine the context of transnational locality in the overall Hallyu fandom in France. The research methodology was based on a literature review and in-depth interviews. The interviews were conducted with 11 students majoring in Korean studies at a French university and 4 French people studying or living in Korea. The formation of Hallyu fandom in France can be seen as a result of the digital environment, and it has been concentrated among teenagers and young adults amidst the prejudice against Asian culture. However, French K-pop fandom has penetrated the cultural environment of France by showing its distinction as ""popular cultural capital"" and embracing self-esteem and social meaning. Three key themes emerge: fandom serves as a cultural and value hierarchy and distinction within which fans navigate their identities; it creates a self-sustaining universe of social interaction, creativity, and participation; and it acts as a gateway to broader Korean culture. As a result, transnational locality in French K-pop fandom can be presented in a way that draws on the transformative power and cultural significance of K-pop fandom and emphasizes its role as a conduit for cultural exchange, global connectivity, and personal transformation.",1306
2024,A Comparative Analysis of International and Domestic New Ventures: Focusing on Board and Firm Characteristics,"This study examines key differences in board and firm characteristics between international new ventures (INVs) and domestic new ventures (DNVs), focusing on how these factors shape the distinctive features of INVs. By analyzing multiple dimensions, including board human and social capital as well as firm operational and financial attributes, this study provides a comprehensive view of factors influencing ventures' pathways to early and rapid internationalization. Based on the Korean ventures listed on the KOSDAQ from 2011 to 2020, this study reveals that board members' international background and financial ties facilitate early international expansion. Additionally, firms with low marketing investments, asset-light operations, and high activity levels strategically position themselves for early internationalization, especially under restrictive domestic financial conditions. This study underscores the importance of specific board and firm resources in becoming INVs, highlighting the strategic value of board composition and financial metrics in driving global growth.",1084
2024,"The Relationships between Interactional Justice, Trust, and Logistics Performance in Supply Chain Management","This study empirically analyzes the impact of justice and trust, both of which fall under the umbrella of business ethics, on the inter-company relationships within the supply chain. The study further investigates how these factors affect the quantitative performance of logistics operations. For the analysis of the research model, interactional justice was divided into interpersonal and informational justice, and trust was divided into cognitive and emotional trust. Subsequently, surveys were conducted with employees in supply chain-related departments in South Korea to explore the pathway that leads to quantitative performance. Hypotheses were then tested through structural equation modeling. An empirical analysis revealed that both interpersonal and informational justice have a significant positive impact on both dimensions of trust and that both cognitive and emotional trust positively affect logistics performance. Based on this study's results, we concluded that interactional justice and trust are key intangible assets within the supply chain that influence quantitative logistics performance. Global supply chains are rapidly changing, undergoing repeated dismantling and reorganization. In such an environment, it is challenging to assert sustainability through existing assets and practices, and the discovery of new growth drivers is gaining attention. This study proposes a new driver for the supply chain by defining justice and trust as intangible assets and deriving a method to quantify them.",1521

2024,How Nationalism Strengthens Military Effectiveness : The Case of Japanese Nationalism in the Russo-Japanese War 1904-05,"Despite the significant impact of nationalism on interstate conflicts, many existing studies on military effectiveness, defined as a state’s ability to convert its resources into military power, have paid relatively little attention to its role in shaping military effectiveness. This paper aims to address this gap by asking the following question: what effects does nationalism have on a state’s military effectiveness? By analyzing the case of Japanese nationalism and its impact on the Russo-Japanese War, this paper argues that nationalism can enhance a state’s military effectiveness in two ways: 1) by providing a source of motivation for military personnel, 2) by contributing to logistic support through effective national mobilization of the public. The findings not only enrich the study on nationalism and state power but also provide valuable insights for South Korean decision-makers, showing how ongoing interstate conflicts around the world that may affect South Korea’s national interests could unfold and highlighting the need to work towards mitigating nationalistic sentiments in its neighboring states.",1123

2024,The Relevance between Managerial Overconfidence and Audit Quality Following the Introduction of the New External Audit Law,"[Purpose] The 2018 implementation of the New External Audit Law is expected to enhance the reliability of financial statements and prevent corporate accounting fraud by expanding the authority of external auditors and increasing the rigor of audit procedures, thereby limiting management’s intervention. This study aims to compare and analyze the relationship between managerial overconfidence and audit quality before and after the introduction of the New External Audit Law to determine whether there is a significant difference.
[Methodology] In this study, the research sample was divided into two periods：Research Sample_1 (2015－2017), representing the period before the introduction of the New External Audit Law, and Research Sample_2 (2020－2022), representing the period after its introduction. A multiple regression analysis was conducted using each sample to verify the relationship between managerial overconfidence and audit quality.
[Findings] Before the implementation of the New External Audit Law (2015－2017), it was found that the higher the level of managerial overconfidence, the lower the audit quality.
However, after the introduction of the New External Audit Law (2020－2022), managerial overconfidence no longer had a significant impact on audit quality. According to the findings of this study, the enhanced independence of external auditors and the increased authority to maintain the accuracy of financial statements following the implementation of the New External Audit Law appear to have reduced instances where managers interfere with the audit process or disrupt it due to overconfidence, thus mitigating the negative impact on audit quality.
[Implications] This study differentiates itself from prior research by comparing and analyzing the relationship between managerial overconfidence and audit quality before and after the introduction of the New External Audit Law in 2018. It provides insights into the effectiveness of the new regulation from the perspective of this relationship. The findings suggest significant policy implications, as they highlight how the law’s implementation has strengthened external auditors’ independence and reduced the negative impact of managerial overconfidence on audit quality. This contributes to the broader understanding of regulatory changes in corporate governance and their role in improving financial reporting reliability.",2401

2024,Associations of Step Volume and Intensity with Metabolic Syndrome among Korean Adults: A Cross-sectional Observational Study,"Purpose: This study was performed to investigate the association between step volume and intensity with the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) in Korean adults.
Methods: The study analyzed 2,038 adults from the 2014 to 2017 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, defining MS based on waist circumference, blood pressure, triglycerides, glucose, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterols. Step volume and intensity were calculated using average number of steps per day and peak 30-minute cadence, respectively. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of MS by tertiles of step volume and intensity. A joint analysis was conducted to examine the combined association between step volume and intensity with the prevalence of MS. We divided the participants into nine groups according to their step volume (tertiles) and intensity (tertiles).
Results: There were 478 MS cases. Compared to the lowest tertile of volume, the ORs of MS were 1.06 (95% CI, 0.79–1.42) and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.47–0.88) in the middle and highest tertile of volume. Compared to the lowest tertile of intensity, the ORs were 1.02 (95% CI, 0.76–1.36) and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.55–1.01) in the middle and highest tertile of intensity. In the joint analysis, compared to the group with both lowest volume and intensity, the ORs were significantly lower in all groups with the highest volume, except the group with the lowest intensity.
Conclusion: Although only greater step volume, not intensity, was independently related to MS, both step volume and intensity appear to be important for preventing MS.",1648

2024,Mechanisms Linking Experiences of Child Abuse and the Perpetration of Intimate Partner Violence: The Moderated Mediating Effect of Aggression and Self-Esteem,"Intimate partner violence(IPV) against women is a pervasive and serious problem in South Korea. Using nationally representative data from the Violence Against Women: Focused on Intimate Partner Violence study, this study explored the underlying mechanisms of IPV perpetration among men in South Korea. Specifically, this research examined whether aggression mediates the relationship between experiencing child abuse and IPV perpetration(i.e., physical and sexual violence) in adulthood. Furthermore, this study tested whether the indirect effect of experiencing child abuse on IPV perpetration via aggression is moderated by self-esteem.
This study revealed that over half of the respondents(54.4%) who perpetrated at least one type of physical or sexual IPV had experienced child abuse. This study found a significant relationship between experiencing child abuse and both physical and sexual IPV perpetration, as well as a significant mediating effect of aggression in this relationship. Furthermore, the study identified that self-esteem moderated the mediating process by which experiences of child abuse affected physical IPV perpetration via aggression, but not sexual IPV perpetration. Implications for IPV prevention and intervention strategies and future research directions are discussed.",1299
2024,On the Performance of Index-Aided Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for V2X Communications,"This paper proposes a novel reliable multiple access scheme for vehicle-to-everything and other applications with similar requirements. The proposed scheme employs index modulation in conjunction with power domain multiplexing to superimpose multiple data streams, destined to multiple receiver nodes, on a set of subcarriers in a non-orthogonal manner. An analytical model for the symbol error probability of the proposed scheme is developed and validated in this paper, through simulations, to provide insights into the performance of the proposed multiple access scheme.
This performance analysis of the symbol error probability is generalized with any numbers of subcarriers and nodes and then we focus on addressing asymptotic results in terms of diversity and coding gains embedded in the proposed multiple access structure. Our analytical model and simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the benchmark schemes such as orthogonal multiple access, non-orthogonal multiple access, in terms of symbol error performance.",1044
2024,A Study on the function of Hedge appearing in the Conversation as a Politeness Strategy for Korean language education,"The purpose of this study is to classify and analysis the functions of the hedge that appears in the conversation as a strategy for expressing politeness. To this end, the dialogue analysis theory was reviewed and the types of dialogue continuum were classified, and through the review of the politeness theory, it was confirmed that hedge is used as a strategy to protect the face of speakers and listeners. The functions of hedge were organized by type of conversation classified through the review of the dialogue analysis theory.

2024,科技竞争背景下中国半导体产业高质量发展对策研究,随着制裁措施不断向资本和技术密集型的半导体产业集中，中美贸易摩擦逐渐升级为中美科技竞争，两国博弈的焦点也由争夺经济利益转变为争夺重塑国际秩序的权力。运用结构性权力理论探讨半导体产业竞争的基本逻辑，不仅有助于了解各国的竞争诉求，还能为产业发展态势评估、产业发展方向确定以及产业发展路径选择提供重要参考。与此同时，受到中美竞争、新冠疫情、俄乌冲突等事件的多重影响，世界主要经济体陆续推行国家安全战略，地缘政治因素成为影响国家经济合作关系、塑造国际秩序的关键变量。在此背景下，从国际政治经济视角分析中国半导体产业发展所处的外部环境具有现实意义。为了寻求中国半导体产业高质量发展的有效路径，本文还梳理了中国半导体产业发展现状，并对产业发展所面临的挑战和存在的问题进行了分析。基于上述研究，本文得出以下结论：半导体产业的结构性权力与产业制造能力、产业技术水平与产业资本构成直接相关；中国半导体产业在全球范围内具有一定程度的影响力，其优势主要集中于产业链中下游的封装测试和终端应用环节，在IP核、EDA软件、半导体材料与加工设备方面则缺乏竞争力；在发展过程中，中国面临美国制裁、国际竞争、地缘政治风险等外部挑战，需要解决人才短缺、资本滥用、行业监管体系不完善等内在问题。因此，中国应持续加大对半导体人才的吸纳和培育力度，利用资本推动技术进步，加强政府和企业的协同合作，通过市场的“开放”与“开拓”提升抗地缘政治风险能力，以实现半导体产业的高质量发展目标。,621
2024,An Empirical Study on the Impact of the European Carbon BorderAdjustment Mechanism on Korean Listed Firms,"[Purpose]This study examines the impact of the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (EU CBAM) on Korean listed firms within the context of global environmental regulations and market dynamics.
[Methodology]This study evaluates the impact of the December 13, 2022, announcement of the final EU CBAM proposal on firm value using the event study methodology. To measure the stock price reactions of listed firms to the EU CBAM, Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CARs) and Buy－and－Hold Abnormal Returns (BHARs) were utilized. Furthermore, regression analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of carbon risk on stock price reactions.
[Findings]This study finds that firms with higher carbon risks－characterized by substantial greenhouse gas emissions, significant energy consumption, and large certified emissions－experience a more pronounced negative impact. Notably, cross－border environmental regimes have a significant effect on the Korean stock market in the medium to long term rather than the short term.
[Policy Implications]The findings of this study suggest that cross border environmental policies have a significant medium－ to long－term impact on the value of domestic firms. These results are expected to provide valuable insights for policymakers in preparing support measures for domestic manufacturing firms in anticipation of stricter cross border environmental policies and in establishing strategic responses at the level of the domestic financial market.",1486
2024,"A Study on the Design Elements and Directions of Residential Spaces for Three-Generation Family Communication -Focused on Apartments in Shenyang, China-","The swift urbanization and rapid economic growth have catalyzed societal shifts within Chinese family structures. As essential hubs of human existence, living spaces must be re-envisioned to reflect evolving cultural and lifestyle shifts. 1)The three-generation family structure, while stable and slightly increasing in presence,2)often goes unnoticed in design considerations. Socioeconomic and cultural progress has increased demands for cultural enrichment within family leisure, thereby altering residential living patterns. The dissolution of traditional family ethics in an era of digital and smart technologies has weakened familial communication and bonds. The design of contemporary residential properties has become homogenized and rigid, failing to meet the diverse cultural, lifestyle, and communicative needs of occupants. This paper aims to analyze the present living spaces of urban three-generation families, outline existing limitations, and explore innovative design interventions that encourage familial interaction and enhance comfort, meeting the multifaceted needs of residency. It builds upon a review of the transitions in modern Chinese domestic dwellings, alongside a decade's statistical analysis and field surveys of Shenyang's apartments, to synthesize residential development trends and residents' needs. It examines the challenges and distinctive features of three-generation living spaces, proposing communicative design principles and elements, intending to guide future research in residential design for multi-generational households.",1569
2024,A Transient Advantage Strategy of Hyundai Motor Company (HMC) -Countermeasure for Poor Result of Chinese Business-,"The HMC rarely gets out of a deep slump in China as of 2023. In order to turn around the sales drop trend, the HMC announced a countermeasure called the ‘Rising Again, For China’ plan in 2021. But it does not obtain a visible outcome yet. Three points of countermeasure are to be a future mobility innovator by launching its own EV models, the product lineup change, and the business region expansion. However, such a poor performance in China does not necessarily mean a risk of whole organization of HMC. In fact, the management result has improved for recent five years since 2018. Owing to a deep slump in China, the HMC could drive actively the ‘Plan B’ covering to develop the alternative markets substituted for China and to upgrade the product lineup. As a result, the HMC’s alternative markets have significantly redeemed the loss in China, and the unit selling price has risen steadily since 2018. The HMC found a way to grow without relying on China. This study managed the ‘Plan B’ of HMC by a transient advantage strategy which promoted by diversification and disengagement. The former is to start a new business or to develop alternative markets, and the latter is to downsize or refocus the products within the organization. From a transient advantage aspect, a better index for revenue & profit is surely a good signal for HMC because it already has been on a very tough situation to make a sustainable advantage in China.",1438
2024,Environmental Change and the Strategic Responses of Public Organizations:Comparative Study of Supreme Audit Institutions during COVID-19,"This study investigates the strategies employed by public organizations to adapt to significant environmental changes, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. It aims to characterize these strategic responses and examine the factors influencing them. The analysis focuses on comparing the crisis response strategies of Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) in seven countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, France, Switzerland, and Korea. Additionally, the study explores how various aspects of the strategic environment, including the external context, organizational characteristics, and institutional framework, impact these crisis responses. Our findings reveal that most SAIs implemented changes in their organizational management and audit operations to ensure government accountability during the crisis. While there were similarities in the strategies employed, differences emerged based on each country’s unique circumstances. Notably, the type of SAI and specific aspects of its institutional context significantly influenced its strategic response. We also observed that the presence of distinct legal provisions enabled public organizations to maintain stability and continuity in performing their essential functions. This study underscores the critical importance of strategic management within public organizations. By comparing the responses of SAIs across the seven exemplar countries, it provides valuable insights with practical implications for enhancing SAI crisis responses in the post-COVID-19 era.",1537

Their achievements in technological innovation, market expansion, and organizational management have attracted widespread attention. Chinese academics have been endeavoring to study multiple aspects of Korean corporations in-depth to analyze their successes and challenges. The purpose of this review is to systematize the current state of research on Korean firms and China-South Korea corporations in Chinese academia, to explore the characteristics and shortcomings of the existing research, and to explore the areas of concern for corporations.
The article takes 78 Korean corporation research papers published in CSSCI journals in the China Knowledge Network database almost 2 decades as a sample and uses the content analysis method to analyze the research papers. These sample literature are systematically analyzed and sorted out in terms of publication year distribution, source journals, authors, funded status of the papers, keywords, specific research areas, and research methods.
The results show that Chinese academics' research on Korean firms and Sino-Korean corporations has been sharply increased and slightly declined recently in a general sense. In terms of areas of interest, corporate governance, investment, and organizational culture has gained sizable attention; however, more rigorous academic efforts will be recommended. On the other hand, relatively few studies on inter-firm cooperation, corporate policy, and legal environment have been conducted. The research method is mostly qualitative research, and the authors believe that more interdisciplinary efforts and theory-based empirical research seem to be required.",1785

While taking and positng a selfie may seem like a simple action of sharing one’s face on SNSs, it has become prevalent in various fields of society, including advertising and marketing. Therefore, to better understand the phenomenon of selfie posting, the current study applies one of the well-established personality theories, Big Five personality theory. Big Five theory is widely used to predict individual attitudes and behaviors based on five major personality traits: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness.
Specifically, this research examined the relationship between the Big Five and selfie posting behaviors (i.e., posting frequency, percentage of selfies, and selfie editing), attitude towards selife posting, and intentions to continue posting selfies in the future. A total of 250 participants who post selfies on SNSs took part in an online survey. The results revealed that extraversion was a predictor of attitude toward and intention to post selfies. Agreeableness was positively associated with selfie editing, attitude toward selfies, and intention to post selfies. Conscientiousness was positively related to attitude toward selfies only. Neuroticism was significantly associated with selfie percentage and intention to post selfies, as well as marginally associated with selfie editing. Interestingly, openness was negatively related to selfie behaviors, attitudes towards selfies, and intention to post selfies. The implications and limitations of the research are discussed.",1623

2024,"A study of motivation formulating, developing, and achieving processes of aspiring headteachers in the secondary school of the Republic of Korea","This study aims to investigate the formulation, development, and achievement of the motivation of aspiring headteachers in secondary schools in the Republic of Korea (hereafter, Korea). Because it is a sought-after position, aspiring headteachers undertake highly competitive and time-consuming processes to become headteachers. Educational leadership is important for school effectiveness and improvement. Understanding the motivation of aspiring headteachers will be useful to support educational leadership preparation.
Thus, a qualitative study was conducted, and thirty-three headteachers were invited to semi-structured interviews to share their motivation from the start until they were appointed. In the findings, leadership capability was revealed as the inevitable reason for formulating motivation. When leadership capability was recognized, the participants were recommended to apply for the educational specialist role or to become the head of the education and research department, which are the typical pathways to becoming a headteacher in the Korean education system. In the development process, firstly, high social status was regarded as the extrinsic motivation (receiving), while financial rewards were not considered as extrinsic motivation. Secondly, being able to have a voice in the school and the education system emerged as a main intrinsic motivation (achieving). Lastly, most aspiring headteachers wanted to contribute to the improvement of the school and the education system; this motivation was linked to transcendent motivation (giving).
Extrinsic motivation was easily shown on the surface, but intrinsic (achieving) and transcendent (giving) motivations were revealed as more meaningful motivations under the surface. Even though these motivations were genuine, educational leadership skills are considered essential to achieving transcendent motivations. This study suggests that it would be helpful for educational leadership preparation programs to be designed with an understanding of aspiring headteachers’ motivation.",2058

2024,A study to analyze the satisfaction of theological education curriculum in order to restructure the theological college curriculum,"Research Objective : The study aimed to investigate the satisfaction with the operation of theological university curricula from the perspective of learners experiencing the theological education curriculum in the field. The goal is to provide a basis for reflective introspection on the current theological education curriculum and for restructuring it to have influential impacts within the church and society.
Content and Methodology : A survey was conducted with 80 learners currently enrolled in undergraduate, graduate, master’s, and doctoral programs at a theological university to analyze satisfaction with current theological education programs. To interpret the survey results progressively, in-depth interviews were conducted with a randomly selected group of 6 participants.
Survey Results : First, the satisfaction with the current theological education programs was found to be 60%, indicating a high level of satisfaction. Second, while 77.5% recognized the need for practical pastoral education, only 45.5% reported that practical pastoral education is currently provided in theological education programs, indicating a lower percentage than the perceived need. Third, 73.7% responded negatively regarding whether the current theological education programs can enhance pastoral competence for future society. Lastly, the areas identified as urgently requiring change for the restructuring of theological education programs were theological education content, methodology, and objectives, in that order.
Conclusion and Recommendations : In an era of great transformation, our society is changing rapidly. In the face of this wave of change, the theological education curriculum also requires adaptation to suit the new era. Traditional theological education courses have primarily focused on imparting theory-centered knowledge. However, theological education in the new era necessitates a curriculum that enhances the pastoral capacity of churches and pastors to dynamically navigate through this era of significant transition. To achieve this, it is imperative to restructure the curriculum to one that is more closely related to the pastoral field. This involves offering a variety of constructivist-based, learner-centered teaching and learning methods within a theory-centered curriculum and methodology. Additionally, it entails establishing a practice-oriented theological school that can actively address the evolving pastoral landscape in this era of great transition. Restructuring of the process is essential to meet these goals.",2555

2024,Examining the EU’s Strategic Narratives on Europe-Asia Connectivity Using Semantic Network Analysis,"This study examines the strategic narratives included in the EU institutions' public communications about Europe-Asia Connectivity. The main methodology employed in this study is semantic network analysis, which is an automated text analysis. The results are displayed as semantic mappings, showcasing five key parts of strategic narratives: actors, scenes, tools, obstacles, and projected endings. The primary actors are the European Union's key allies in Northeast Asia, namely China, Japan, and South Korea. ASEM served as the primary setting in the EU's connectivity strategy. The EU's instruments indicated its normative impact on the world economy and environment. The EU's connection policy highlights climate change, socio-economic issues, and the COVID-19 pandemic as barriers. The proper evaluation of the EU's capacity could be significant for overcoming these challenges. Assessing the EU's capability can demonstrate its significant influence and identify potential challenges in the connectivity strategy. The EU's lack of clarity on its strategic visions from the anticipated outcomes may not be persuasive to potential partners of the EU. The EU made significant efforts to strengthen its strategic narratives by creating engaging stories for potential partners. In order to do this, the EU must demonstrate its worldwide influence by proactive promotion and collaboration with partners who could endorse the EU's connectivity policy.",1450
2024,"A Study on the Evolutionary Expression of Sun Wukong's Image From a Rhetorical Perspective -Focusing on Chinese, American, and Japanese Animation-","In animated works, successful images often conceal a systematic and perfected design of symbolic typical features. It is essential for the design of animated image to establish typicality and uniqueness, and form accurate, recognizable and readable signs to distinct from other images. Sun Wukong, as one of the most long-standing and widely spread animated character globally, presents an intriguing case study of how it transcends temporal and cultural boundaries to become a global animated image. This paper views it through the perspective of semiotics, aiming to provide a novel interpretation of this trans-cultural phenomenon. The study selects Sun Wukong’s representations from four representative animations in China, Japan, and the United States as research subjects. Initially, it deconstructs these varied representations of Sun Wukong, extracts their signs, and analyzes their signifiers and signified, including tracing their origins. Then, within the theoretical framework of ""The Evolution of Four Master Tropes"" in semiotics, it outlines the evolutionary process of the signified. This progression is from ""Metaphor"" to ""Metonymy"", ""Synecdoche"", and finally to ""Irony"". These four rhetorical tropes correspond to ""Sun Wukong as a deity"", ""Sun Wukong as a hero"", ""Sun Wukong as a human"" and ""Sun Wukong as an illusion"", respectively. Ultimately, it reveals that under diverse historical conditions and cultural backgrounds, the core essence of Sun Wukong's charm remains intact. It is this enduring spiritual core that continuously generates new symbolic signifiers, enabling Sun Wukong to resonate emotionally with audiences across different times and spaces.",1677

2024,Money Fever and Morality Discourse in the Yanbian Korean Chinese Autonomous Prefecture: Embracing and Critiquing Neoliberalism in the Beginning of the Postsocialist China,"This article explores the ways in which the Korean Chinese intellectuals and middle class residents in the Yanbian Korean Chinese ethnic autonomous prefecture (hereafter Yanbian) associated the pursuit of economic wealth with the state of moral crisis, so-called money fever (don yeolbyeong), and further l inked it to not only the cultural degradation, but also the political downfall of the Korean Chinese ethnic community. Unlike most critiques of the discrepancy of wealth in other regions of China condemned the new rich in the beginning of the economic reform era, the Korean Chinese scholars and public in general in Yanbian disparaged the lifestyle of the working-class poor and urged them to regain traditional ethics and morals to salvage the Korean Chinese communities in China. In addition, they viewed the South Korean capitalism as a main source through which indigent Korean Chinese gained impaired moral senses. This article is based on my analysis of scholarly writings from the early 1990s to the end of the 2000s and semi-structured interviews I have conducted during my ethnographic fieldwork between 2005 and 2007 on the topics of moral degeneracy. I argue that the money fever discourse was a class-based exhibition of the emerging social inequality in the beginning of the postsocialist era in China. Instead of vocalizing their economic and political marginalization in this ethnic rust belt in Northeast China, I demonstrate that, the Korean Chinese intellectuals and leaders seeked to preserve their community's place in multiethnic China by denouncing the South Korean capitalism and by scapegoating the Korean Chinese working class.",1660
2024,Overview of the Korean Marine Industry and VPP Analysis of a 28ft Sailing Yacht,"The South Korean marine industry is emerging as a significant market, driven by the growing popularity of various water leisure activities, including sailing. This trend suggests a rising demand for sailing yachts. Consequently, since 2022, the design and development of a 28ft sailing yacht have been ongoing, supported by the government and the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, to promote yachting culture in South Korea. The Velocity Prediction Program (VPP) analysis was conducted using WinDesign during the preliminary design stage to evaluate performance and determine design parameters. The hydrodynamic model used for this vessel is based on regression methods developed from years of experience in naval architecture and yacht research at the Wolfson Unit, providing reliable estimates for most modern yachts. However, owing to the lack of specific hydrodynamic data from towing tank tests or CFD numerical analysis, verification of the hydrodynamic model has faced some challenges. Additionally, an incomplete weight estimate resulted in variable VCG values, potentially affecting stability and overall performance. The optimal boat speed for this vessel was determined at true wind speeds (TWS) of 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 knots, using both the jib (up to 120° TWA) and the spinnaker (from 80° TWA). The optimized speed of the yacht was found to be comparable to that of international similar-class yachts.",1414

Conclusion: This study identified physical indicators in Korean middle-aged women linked to menopausal symptoms.
This study suggests that exercise programs for middle-aged women should include resistance training and promote physical activity to improve obesity markers and manage menopausal symptoms for healthy aging.",1417
2024,A Primary Study on the Applicability of Gel-Type Filler Materials to Root Pass Welds of the Thick Plate,"Welding generally uses filler material to create deposited weld metal. Filler materials play a significant role in welding by providing the material needed to fill and form the joint. Existing filler materials are limited in the workspace and welding position and need help responding flexibly to welds of complex shapes. This study conducted primary research to develop a gel-type filler material with adhesion and flexibility that can cope with limited workspace and location. We attempted to provide a new approach to welding by mixing metal powder and binder to create a gel-type filler material. Root pass welding of thick plates was performed using a laser heat source. The bead appearance and cross-section of the weld zone were observed according to the type and composition of the metal powder, the binder content, and the method of synthesizing the metal powder. The physical characteristics of the weld were analyzed through observation of the hardness and microstructure of the weld.",995
2024,A Study of the Effects of Periodic Auditor Designation System on the Restatements of the Financial Statements,"This study analyzes the effects of the introduction of periodic auditor designation system stipulated in the ‘Act on External Audit of Stock Companies, etc.’ (hereinafter, the Revised Audit Act) on the restatements of the financial statements. For companies listed on the KOSPI and KOSDAQ markets from 2015 to 2022 this study analyzed the effects of periodic auditor designation system on the restatements of the financial statements. The main variables of interest in this study, a variable of before and after the introduction of periodic auditor designation system, a variable of whether or not the companies subject to periodic auditor designation system, and a variable of the first year designation of periodic auditors, significantly decrease the restatements of the financial statements. Nevertheless, this study finds that the corrections of financial items in accounting reports have increased since the introduction of periodic auditor designation system.
Increases in the corrections of financial items can be interpreted as a positive effect of increasing the reliability of the financial statements by correcting differences with management in the financial statements.
These results present empirical evidence that periodic auditor designation system can increase the transparency of the accounting reports. On the other hand, due to the short implementation period of periodic auditor designation system this study does not analyze whether the introduction of periodic auditor designation system maintains higher auditor independence and a certain level of accounting transparency in the long run.",1613

2024,A Study on the Influence Factors of Sensory Experience on Chinese Students' Continuance Learning Intention in VR Fine Arts Education,"Virtual Reality (VR) technology is rapidly integrating into the education field, creating immersive and interactive learning experiences for learners, and showing tremendous potential, especially in fine arts education. VR fine arts education can break through spatial and temporal limitations, provide close access to scarce art resources, and stimulate learners' creativity and interest in learning. However, there is a lack of in-depth research on the factors influencing learners' continuance learning intention, particularly the mechanism of sensory experience. This study aims to explore how visual and tactile experiences in VR fine arts education affect students' continuance learning intention through sense of presence and flow experience. A questionnaire survey was conducted among 406 Chinese students who had used VR devices in their art courses, and structural equation modeling was used for analysis. The results show that visual experience significantly enhances the sense of presence and flow experience, thereby promoting continuance learning intention; tactile experience has a positive impact on flow experience but no significant effect on the sense of presence. The study reveals the differential mechanisms of sensory experience in VR fine arts education, providing a theoretical basis for optimizing VR art teaching design.

2024,Teachers’ Views of L1 Use in English Speaking Classes : A Case Study of University Teachers in Korea,"This study investigates the views of university English teachers in Korea teaching English speaking classes to develop a greater understanding of how L1 is used and for what reasons and purposes in the classroom. The primary means of data collection included a survey with multiple choice questions and open-ended questions, as well as semi-structured interviews. Thirteen teachers, five native English-speaking teachers (NESTs) and eight Korean English teachers (KETs) responded to the survey, among whom four teachers participated in the interviews. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics or qualitative methods, depending on their types. Findings revealed that teachers attempted to use English as the primary medium of instruction, adhering to class identity and their teaching beliefs. However, the majority also found themselves allowing for the use of Korean to some extent for reasons such as the students’ low English proficiency, course goals, the tense environment, common L1 among students, and the students’ demand, although some differences were observed in the way that Korean was used between NESTs and KETs. Teachers also showed more leniency towards the students’ Korean use as opposed to their own use of it and employed Korean for different purposes in each case. Discrepancies were found between NESTs and KETs in their purposes. For instance, NESTs focused their use of Korean on social purposes while KETs focused on managerial purposes.
NESTs permitted students to use Korean for various purposes, whereas KETs focused mainly on affective and social purposes. However, both groups seldom considered the students’ use of Korean for linguistic purposes. Further discussions on implications for teachers, education administrators, and researchers are provided.",1804

2024,Firearms Detection Software Using Deep Learning and IoT for Firearms assaults in Lima – Peru,"Civil security is a major concern in Lima, Peru, where crimes committed with firearms have become a significant issue affecting citizens' daily lives. Data indicates that firearms were used in 14% of crimes committed against individuals over 15 years of age from January to June 2021, which represents approximately 102,000 criminal acts in a six-month period. As a result, citizens are seeking alternative security measures, given the limited ability of the government to provide adequate protection. One such measure is the installation of closed-circuit television (CCTV) security cameras. However, the challenge with this approach is the lack of monitoring, which makes it a reactive solution. The present research aims to address this issue by analyzing the potential of using deep learning models and the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance the security situation.

Today, Korean society is forming a multicultural society with the influx of many migrants. However, since the global citizenship education program operated including them is not a regular curriculum, the reality is that learning contents are operated differently depending on the operating entity or the subject of the class. Therefore, systematic programs for global citizenship education need to be provided from the lower grades of elementary school. In general, the fields of global citizenship education are largely ‘race’, ‘bias’, and ‘conflict’. Among them, Han Jung-young's fairy tale “The Child Who Weaves the Coffin” (2013) can be a desirable educational sanction for elementary school learners when trying to deal with complex problems. The fairy tale tells the story of the Turkana people in Kenya, Africa, who suffer from drinking water shortages. Kiare's story includes a variety of content, including drinking water problems, water pollution, conflicts and wars with neighboring Uganda over water. In this study, based on the principle of commerce and culture, elementary school learners investigate the drinking water problems, ethnic conflicts, and educational problems experienced by African countries through this fairy tale, and by contemplating them together, a plan to construct educational content that can naturally grow as a global citizen was suggested.",1568

Conclusion: Fetal deaths due to congenital anomalies showed a decreasing trend, but the risks, such as multiple fetuses and advanced maternal age are increasing in Korea. Therefore, careful monitoring of fetal deaths due to congenital anomalies are essential.",1712
2024,Association between Change in Sitting Time and Risk of Developing Hypertension: An 8-Year Longitudinal Follow-up Study with Cohort Data Analysis in Korea,"Purpose: This study aims to investigate the association between changes in sitting time based on sex and levels of physical activity participation and the risk of hypertension.
Methods: Conducted as a follow-up to the 2011–2012 baseline survey in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study community-based cohort study, the 4th tracking took place from 2019 to 2020 in Korea, involving adults aged 49 to 79 years. Hypertension status was determined based on systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg, self-reported diagnosis, or medication usage. Change in sitting time was measured using a physical activity questionnaire. The study utilized multivariate extended Cox regression models to calculate independent risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk of developing hypertension based on change in sitting time, with a significance level set at p＜ 0.05.
Results: Despite adjusting for various factors affecting sitting time and hypertension, total sitting time (hazard ratio [HR], 1.37; 95% CI, 1.05–1.78) and weekday sitting time (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.03–1.76) in the newly ST group showed increased risk of developing hypertension. It was observed that increased total and weekday sitting time in males could elevate hypertension risk (total newly ST: HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.05–2.21; weekday newly ST: HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.08–2.28). Additionally, the association between changes in sitting time and risk of developing hypertension varied based on leisure-related physical activity levels.
Conclusion: The study confirms that increased sitting time raises the risk of hypertension and that reducing sitting time in physically inactive adults can lower the risk of developing hypertension.",1729

2024,Recent Trends in Leveraging Processing-in-Memory for Accelerating Relational Database Management Systems,"In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on recent research exploiting Processing-In-Memory (PIM) to enhance the performanceof Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs). PIM integrates In-Memory Processors (IMPs) near memory banks, allowingmemory-intensive operations to leverage the high internal memory bandwidth and computational capabilities of IMPs. Given that manykey operations of RDBMSs are memory-heavy and require a large number of frequent memory accesses, PIM has emerged as a promisingsolution for accelerating RDBMSs. We provide an overview of the key architectural characteristics of commodity PIM-enabled memorydevices, examine how recent studies have applied PIM to accelerate RDBMSs, and explore potential research directions in PIM-acceleratedRDBMSs.",783
2024,Understanding Customers’ Purchase Intentions of Luxury Fashion NFTs: The Roles of Brand Engagement and Perceived Risk,"The application of NFT technology is attracting a lot of attention with corporations trying to leverage the opportunities in the augmented reality, however, the use of the NFT technology is still in its early stages. Luxury industry has started to utilize NFT (Non-fungible token) technology in a variety of ways: applying NFTs as an authenticity certificate or launching NFTs as separate marketable products. The proposed study investigates the factors influencing luxury brands’ NFTs purchase intention employing the SOR framework. Firstly, we applied external stimuli (perceived scarcity, brand image, and social influence) reflecting NFTs characteristics, brand and media; and internal stimuli (status consumption and NFT knowledge) that reflect consumers’ personal traits, to examine whether brand engagement and perceived risk influence purchase intention. Empirical research method was employed by conducting a survey using a panel survey research firm, and Gucci and Prada NFTs on NFT marketplaces were used as experimental tool. The final data analysis was conducted using Smart PLS-SEM software to test the hypotheses based on a total of 348 responses. We also conducted multi-group analysis (MGA) to study the difference between generational cohorts comparing Millennial and Generation Z generations to the older generation group of Boomers and Generation X, since NFTs are tend to be targeted towards younger consumers. This paper has important implications for research on understanding consumer behavior in regards to luxury fashion and NFTs and potential practical implications for related companies’ marketing efforts.",1634
2024,Investigating the Impact of L2 Learners' Individual Differences on Contextual Processing in English-Medium Instruction,"There has been notable increase as a result of the English-medium instruction rapidly expanding in response to higher education globalization trends. The questionof whether students can learn topic knowledge when it is taught in a language inwhich they are not proficient is a crucial one in English-medium instruction research. Few studies have looked into the actual learning processes involved, despite the fact that prior research has mostly concentrated on how English-medium instruction affects measurable learning outcomes. The purpose of this study is to find out how much content knowledge is processed during English-medium instruction lectures by students using deep-level methods, i.e., critical thought, detailed information, and structure. Furthermore, the study investigates the potential correlation between the implementation of such strategies and the motivating beliefs and English listening proficiency of students. Using a mixed-methods approach, questionnaire responses and semi-structured interviews from 60 students in Korea were gathered. The results emphasize that students' self efficacy and intrinsic learning goals are more important indicators of their use of deep processing strategies than is their English listening competency. This study also offers lecturers and program designers insightful suggestions for supporting meaningful subject learning in English-medium instruction contexts.",1421
